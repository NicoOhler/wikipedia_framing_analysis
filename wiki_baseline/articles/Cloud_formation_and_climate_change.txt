Nephology (; from the Greek word nephos for 'cloud') is the study of clouds and cloud formation. British meteorologist Luke Howard was a major researcher within this field, establishing a cloud classification system.
While this branch of meteorology still exists today, the term nephology, or nephologist is rarely used. The term came into use at the end of the nineteenth century, and fell out of common use by the middle of the twentieth. Recently, interest in nephology has increased as some meteorologists have begun to focus on the relationship between clouds and global warming, which is a source of uncertainty regarding "estimates and interpretations of the Earth’s changing energy budget."

Since the late 1990s, some have suggested that when high solar activity lowers levels of cosmic rays, that in turn reduces cloud cover and warms the planet. Others say that there is no statistical evidence for such an effect. [1]
Some nephologists believe that an increase in global temperature could decrease the thickness and brightness (ability to reflect light energy), which would further increase global temperature.
Understanding the dynamics of cloud formation is essential, as clouds play a significant role in the Earth's energy balance and climate system. Recent research has focused on how changes in cloud cover and characteristics may affect, and be affected by, the Earth's changing climate.

Cloud formation
Cloud formation is a complex process that begins with the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere. This process typically occurs when moist air rises and cools to its dew point, leading to the formation of water droplets or ice crystals. Several factors influence cloud formation, including atmospheric temperature, humidity, and the presence of aerosols. Cloud types are classified based on their appearance and altitude, with major categories including cirrus, cumulus, and stratus. Understanding these processes is fundamental to studying weather patterns and climate dynamics.

Cloud formation and climate change
The interaction between cloud formation and climate change is an aspect of atmospheric science. Clouds have a dual role in the Earth's climate system: they can cool the Earth's surface by reflecting incoming solar radiation (albedo effect) and warm it by trapping outgoing infrared radiation (greenhouse effect). The overall impact of clouds on global climate depends on factors such as cloud type, altitude, thickness, and the amount of water or ice they contain.
Thin, high-altitude cirrus clouds tend to have a net warming effect, since they allow incoming solar radiation to pass through while trapping heat radiating from the Earth's surface. On the other hand, low-altitude, thick clouds like stratus or cumulus generally reflect more sunlight back into space, contributing to a cooling effect. However, the extent to which different types of clouds contribute to warming or cooling is still an area of ongoing research.
Climate change is expected to impact cloud formation patterns, potentially leading to feedback loops. Warmer temperatures can increase the rate of evaporation, leading to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which could result in more clouds. This increase in cloud cover could have a cooling effect due to increased albedo. However, if the increase is primarily in high-altitude thin clouds, the net effect could be additional warming. Conversely, a decrease in cloudiness in certain regions could lead to further surface warming.
Recent studies also suggest that cloud formation is sensitive to aerosols – tiny particles in the atmosphere. Aerosols can act as cloud condensation nuclei, around which cloud droplets can form. Changes in aerosol concentrations, due to human activities or natural processes, can therefore influence cloud properties and, consequently, the climate.
Moreover, climate models show varying degrees of sensitivity to cloud feedbacks, contributing to uncertainties in future climate projections. The challenge for scientists is to understand and accurately model the myriad ways clouds interact with atmospheric dynamics, solar radiation, and the Earth's surface. This understanding is critical for predicting future climate scenarios and informing global strategies to address climate change.

Recent research and studies
Recent research in nephology has delved into the relationship between cloud formation and climate change. One area of study has been the potential link between solar activity, cosmic rays, and cloud cover. One hypothesis suggests that high solar activity, which reduces cosmic ray flux, might lead to decreased cloud cover, thereby warming the planet. However, this theory remains a subject of debate among scientists. Work has been undertaken at CERN's CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) experiment, investigating the microphysical interactions between cosmic rays and cloud formation. These studies aim to increase understand the cloud nucleation process and its implications for climate models.

Implications
Understanding how clouds respond to and influence global warming is necessary for accurate climate modeling and prediction. Changes in cloud cover and type could either exacerbate or mitigate the effects of climate change, depending on their properties and distribution. For instance, thinning high-altitude clouds tend to have a net warming effect, while thick, low-altitude clouds generally have a cooling effect. Increased knowledge in this field can inform policy decisions and strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation. It underscores the need for comprehensive climate models that accurately represent cloud dynamics and their feedback mechanisms in the Earth's climate system.
