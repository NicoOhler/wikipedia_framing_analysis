'''Abortion-rights movements''', also self-styled as [[Pro-choice (term)|pro-choice]] movements, advocate for the right to have [[Abortion law|legal]] access to induced [[abortion]] services including elective abortion.  They seek to represent and support women who wish to terminate their pregnancy without fear of legal or social backlash.  These movements are in direct opposition to [[anti-abortion movements]].

The issue of induced abortion remains divisive in public life, with [[Abortion debate|recurring arguments]] to liberalize or to restrict access to legal abortion services. Some abortion-rights supporters are divided as to the types of abortion services that should be available under different circumstances, including periods in the pregnancy such as [[Late termination of pregnancy|late term abortions]], in which access may or may not be restricted.

==Terminology==
{{Further|Abortion debate#Terminology}}
Many of the terms used in the debate are [[Framing (social sciences)|political framing]] terms used to validate one's own stance while invalidating the opposition's. For example, the labels [[pro-choice and pro-life]] imply endorsement of widely held values such as [[liberty]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], while suggesting that the opposition must be "anti-choice" or "anti-life".<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Constructionist Research |last1=Holstein|first1= James A. |last2=Gubrium |first2= Jaber F.|name-list-style=amp |publisher= Guilford Press |year=2008 |isbn = 9781593853051}}</ref>

These views do not always fall along a binary; in one [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll, they noted that the vagueness of the terms led to seven in ten Americans describing themselves as "pro-choice", while almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/06/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/ |publisher=Public Religion Research Institute |title=Committed to Availability, Conflicted about Morality: What the Millennial Generation Tells Us about the Future of the Abortion Debate and the Culture Wars |date=June 9, 2011}}</ref> It was found that, in polling, respondents would label themselves differently when given specific details about the circumstances around an abortion including factors such as rape, incest, viability of the fetus, and survivability of the mother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/the-big-pro-life-shift-in-a-new-poll-is-an-illusion.html|title=The Big 'Pro-Life' Shift in a New Poll Is an Illusion|last=Kilgore|first=Ed|date=May 25, 2019|website=Intelligencer|language=en|access-date=July 23, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
Abortion practices date back to 1550 [[Common Era|BCE]], based on the findings of practices recorded on documents. Abortion has been an active practice since Egyptian medicine. Centuries later, abortion was a topic taken up by [[feminism]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Ph. D.|first1=Religion and Society|last2=M. A.|first2=Humanities|last3=B.

According to historian James C.

The press played a key role in rallying support for anti-abortion laws.<ref name="Hardin 1978"/>

The ideas of the legalization of abortion in the late 19th century were often opposed by feminists, seeing it as a means of relieving men of responsibility.<ref>Gordon, Sarah Barringer.

Between 1900 and 1965, there were not any [[anti-abortion movements]] or rallies because states had already passed a law banning abortions at all levels, including prescriptions and procedures. The only exception for a woman to get an abortion without fear of legal retribution was if a licensed physician determined the abortion would protect the mother's life. Physicians who provide abortions and women who have abortions were constantly harassed by courts and prosecutors. In the 1960s, some states began to request changes with the abortion law. In 1959, a group of experts set up a model enactment that supported the advancement of the abortion laws. These experts suggested that the abortion laws should provide exemptions for women that were sexually assaulted or for a baby that may not have a good quality of life. The abortion-rights movement became a controversial topic in the United States regarding abortion and reproduction.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Stella Browne.gif|thumb|[[Stella Browne]] was a feminist who campaigned for the liberalization of abortion law.]]
The movement towards the liberalization of abortion law emerged in the 1920s and 1930s in the context of the victories that had been recently won in the area of [[birth control]]. Campaigners including [[Marie Stopes]] in England and [[Margaret Sanger]] in the US had succeeded in bringing the issue into the open, and birth control clinics were established which offered family planning advice and contraceptive methods to women in need. [[Birth control]] is a method of pregnancy prevention through controlled contraception.

In 1929, the [[Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929|Infant Life Preservation Act]] was passed in the [[United Kingdom]], which amended the law ([[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]) so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offense.<ref>[[Hansard|HL Deb]]. Vol 72. [https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1928/nov/22/preservation-of-infant-life-bill-hl|Col 269].</ref> Many citizens had mixed opinions on this, but ultimately started protesting this as child destruction. Child destruction was known as taking the life of a viable unborn child during a pregnancy or at birth, before it is independent of its mother. If there is an intent of death and no good faith is carried out in the process in order to protect the mother's livelihood, the offense carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. The Infant Life Preservation Act defines the difference between murder and abortion-the causing of a miscarriage.<ref>{{Cite web|title=child destruction|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095607263|access-date=April 8, 2021|website=Oxford Reference|language=en}}</ref>

[[Stella Browne]] was a leading birth control campaigner, who increasingly began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced by the work of [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Edward Carpenter]] and other [[sexologists]].<ref name="Hall">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Lesley|title=The Life and Times of Stella Browne: Feminist and Free Spirit|year=2011|pages=27–178|isbn =9781848855830|publisher = Bloomsbury Academic}}</ref> She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labor during her pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Greta |title=Women and eugenics in Britain: The case of Mary Scharlieb, Elizabeth Sloan Chesser, and Stella Browne |journal=Annals of Science |date=September 1995 |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=481–502 |doi=10.1080/00033799500200361 |pmid=11640067 }}</ref> In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowbotham|first=Sheila|title=A New World for Women: Stella Browne, Socialist Feminist|year=1977|pages=66–67|isbn = 9780904383546|publisher = Pluto Press}}</ref>

In the late 1920s, Browne began a speaking tour around England, providing information about her beliefs on the need for accessibility of information about birth control for women, women's health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics.<ref name="Hall"/> These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman's right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929, she brought forward her lecture "The Right to Abortion" in front of the [[World Sexual Reform Congress]] in London.<ref name="Hall"/> In 1931, Browne began to develop her argument for women's right to decide to have an [[abortion]].<ref name="Hall"/> She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning.<ref name="Hall"/>

[[File:Aleck bourne trial.jpg|thumb|[[Aleck Bourne]] was acquitted for performing an abortion on a rape survivor in 1938, a landmark case in the movement for abortion rights.]]
Other prominent feminists, including [[Frida Laski]], [[Dora Russell]], [[Joan Malleson]] and [[Janet Chance]] began to champion this cause – the cause broke dramatically into the mainstream in July 1932 when the [[British Medical Association]] council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion.<ref name="Hall"/> On February 17, 1936, [[Janet Chance]], Alice Jenkins and Joan Malleson established the [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] as the first [[advocacy]] organization for abortion liberalization. The association promoted access to [[abortion in the United Kingdom]] and campaigned for the elimination of legal obstacles.<ref name="HindellSimms">{{cite journal|last=Hindell|first=Keith|author2=Madeline Simms|title=How the Abortion Lobby Worked|year=1968|journal=[[The Political Quarterly]]|pages=271–272}}</ref> In its first year ALRA recruited 35 members, and by 1939 had almost 400 members.<ref name="HindellSimms"/>

The ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA's Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA.<ref name="HindellSimms"/>

In 1938, Joan Malleson precipitated one of the most influential cases in British abortion law when she referred a pregnant fourteen-year old [[rape]] survivor to [[gynaecology|gynaecologist]] [[Aleck Bourne]]. He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial on charges of procuring abortion. Bourne was eventually acquitted in ''R v. Bourne''as his actions were "...an example of disinterested conduct in consonance with the highest traditions of the profession".<ref>''R v Bourne'' [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, [[Court of Criminal Appeal (England and Wales)|CCA]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iclr.co.uk/document/1890233046/casereport_25713/html |title=''R v Bourne'' [1939] 1 KB 687, CCC |date=July 19, 1938 |website=ICLR |url-access=subscription}}</ref> This court case set a precedent that doctors could not be prosecuted for performing an abortion in cases where pregnancy would probably cause "mental and physical wreck".

The [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] continued its campaigning after the Second World War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] [[John Peel (gynaecologist)|John Peel]] chaired the committee advising the [[British Government]] on what became the [[Abortion Act 1967]], which allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks.<ref name="Commons 1967">House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee.

In America an abortion reform movement emerged in the 1960s. In 1964, [[Gerri Santoro]] of [[Connecticut]] died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the abortion rights movement. Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as "[[Jane Collective|Jane]]" operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find "Jane".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwluherstory.org/something-real-jane-and-me-memories-and-exhortations-of-a-feminist-ex-abortionist.html|title=Something Real: Jane and Me.

In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. The forerunner of the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] was formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nwhn.org/content/index.php?pid=106 |website=National Women's Health Network |title=Pat Maginnis |access-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-date=October 28, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028193312/http://www.nwhn.org/content/index.php?pid=106 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In late 1973, NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League.

The landmark judicial ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. This was back in 1970, where Jane Roe, (which was actually a fictional name used in the court documents in order to protect the plaintiff's identity), had filed a lawsuit against Henry Wade. He was the district attorney of Dallas County in Texas, where Jane Roe resided. She was challenging a Texas law making abortion illegal except by a doctor's orders to save a woman's life. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being in the decision ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', delivered concurrently.

From the 1970s, and the spread of [[second-wave feminism]], abortion and [[reproductive rights]] became unifying issues among various [[feminism|women's rights]] groups in Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, France, Germany, and Italy.<ref>LeGates, Marlene.

The actress and many others believe that it is important for women to speak up and shift the narrative, especially because abortion is such a taboo subject.

In the mid-19th century, concerns around abortion only consisted of the danger of a woman being poisoned and risking her health, not because of religion, ethics, or diplomacy. Ending a pregnancy before the fetus began movement, or "post-quickening" was only a wrongdoing, not a crime. The laws that were against abortions post-quickening removals were put in place to protect the well-being of the women that were pregnant, not the fetal life. It was more common for women to die during early terminations due to the usage of pre-owned instruments as opposed to natural abortifacients. Some women who engaged in quickening abortions were not prosecuted because there was no evidence and quickening was hard to prove.

Between 1900 and 1965, there were not any anti-abortion movements or rallies because states had already passed a law banning abortions at all levels included the prescription of drugs or undergoing procedures. The only exception for a woman to proceed with an abortion without worrying about breaking any anti-abortion laws is if a licensed physician were to prove that the abortion was for the protection of the mother's life. Abortion care providers and women who had obtained an abortion were pestered by courts and prosecutors.

In the 1960s, some states began to request changes, around the abortion law, from their states. In 1959, a group of experts set up a model enactment that supported the advancement of the fetus removal laws that were put in place. These experts suggested that the abortion laws should exempt women that were sexually assaulted, whose babies well-being were to be questioned and whose babies that were to be born out of its true, natural or original state. The Abortion Rights Movement became a cultural shift in The United States about the intentions of reproduction and abortion.

In 1973, the ''Roe v. Wade'' verdict changed the abortion laws altogether, making abortion legal. Many physicians and healthcare professionals jeopardized their medical licenses, risked being put in prison and fined by the state because they wanted to continue to provide abortions.

There were more than 1,000 abortion laws passed and enacted between 2011 and 2019 that limited access to abortion procedures. Some of these laws forbid a woman getting an abortion past a certain gestational age and was also based on race and specific pregnancy conditions. Other laws were established that ban particular abortion methods.

Targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) was put in place to target abortion clinics by demanding unnecessary requirements that made it hard for women to get an abortion. Anti-abortion rights claim that these requirements are for the safety of the mother and child, but that has not been scientifically proven. TRAP has placed limitations on abortion facilities to make it more difficult for them to provide abortion services that will essentially force them to not provide abortion services at all. TRAP policies have been put in place by 26 states as of 2020. During the pandemic, numerous states prohibited non-essential medical procedures, including abortion services. Policymakers in twelve states saw this as a chance to certify abortion as non-essential, therefore ending services.

===Africa===

[[Abortion in South Africa|South Africa]] allows abortion on demand under its [[Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act]]. Most African nations, however, have abortion bans except in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk. A number of abortion-rights international organizations have made altering abortion laws and expanding [[family planning]] services in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[developing world]] a top priority.

To classify the reasons as to which abortion should be legally permitted, countries in Africa fall within six categories: abortion is not permitted at all, abortion is only allowed to save the life of a woman, abortion can be performed if a woman's physical health is at risk, to save the mental health of a woman, to save or preserve socioeconomic reasons and abortions are allowed without any restrictions. But there are only five countries in Africa where abortion is legal and those countries are Cape Verde, South Africa, Tunisia, Mozambique and Saõ Tome & Principe.<ref name=":1" />

During 2010–2014. 8.2 million abortions were performed each year in Africa. This number increased drastically compared to the 4.6 million abortions that were performed during 1990–1994. But this increased number of abortions is due to the increase of women that are reproducing at a young age.<ref name="Harrington">{{Cite web|last1=Harrington|first1=Rebecca|last2=Hamp|first2=Karen|last3=a|last4=MPH|title=Women Urgently Need Safe Abortion Services in Africa|url=https://www.populationconnection.org/article/women-urgently-need-safe-abortion-services-in-africa/|access-date=April 9, 2021|website=Population Connection|language=en}}</ref> Approximately 93% of women within their reproductive age live in countries that have very restrictive abortion laws and abortion is only legal in 10 out of 54 African countries, leading to fewer women not being able to obtain a safe procedure. The World Health Organization only recommends trained personnel when performing induced abortions but not many women in Africa have access to trained professionals who are able to provide them with the best service to decrease the number of complications due to abortion. Approximately 1.6 million women are treated for abortion-related complications and only one in four abortions in Africa are safe. Africa has the highest number of deaths that are related to abortion and this is due to the most common complication of abortion that consist of excessive blood loss and an incomplete abortion that can lead to an infection.<ref name="Harrington"/>

=== Asia ===
During 2010–2014, 36 million abortions were performed in Asia. Majority of abortions occurred in Central and South Asia at a rate of 16 million in India and Asia and 13 million in China alone.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Kane-Hartnett|first=Liza|date=November 9, 2018|title=Building Support for Safe Abortion in Asia, One Network at a Time|url=https://iwhc.org/2018/11/building-support-safe-abortion-asia-one-network-time/|access-date=April 9, 2021|website=International Women's Health Coalition|language=en-US|archive-date=November 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115045429/https://iwhc.org/2018/11/building-support-safe-abortion-asia-one-network-time/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Although the abortions performed in Asia are not known, there is an estimated 4.6 million women who are treated because they have complications due to the performance of an unsafe abortion. The major complication of abortion is an incomplete abortion where a woman can experience an immoderate amount of blood loss and can develop an infection. Less common complications of abortion include a woman going into septic shock, damaging the internal organs and causing the peritoneum to be inflamed, all due to the unclean and unsterilized instruments that are being used doing the procedure. Untreated complications from abortions can leave women to experience negative health consequences for life that include infertility, chronic pain, inflammation of the reproductive organs and pelvic inflammatory disease.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Guttmacher Institute|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/|access-date=April 9, 2021|website=Guttmacher Institute|language=en}}</ref> Unsafe abortions go deeper than just a woman's health but they lead to reduced productivity for women increased costs to an already struggling family. Although it is not completely known, a drug known as misoprostol is used to perform abortions in Asian countries and evidence shows that the sales of this drug has increased in Asia over the course of years.<ref name=":1" />

On record, out of all the pregnancies in Asia, 27 percent of them end in abortions. This is the reason for the Asia Safe Abortion Partnership (ASAP). <ref name=":0" /> This program was formed to increase the accessibility to safe and legal abortions and health care that is needed after any abortion service. 50 countries occupy Asia and out of those 50, 17 countries do not have a restriction on abortions excluding, gestational limits and permission from a spouse or parent. ASAP satisfies the demand for safe and accessible abortions through educational and advocacy. By grouping with other countries to promote advocacy networks, ASAP has created a worldwide and generational feminist power that advocates for women's abortion rights, autonomy and dignity. Anti-abortion groups have tried their best to discriminate the reproductive autonomy of women but ASAP has members spread across 20 countries that promote the women's movement for abortion rights, laws, and access. 

Even though abortion is legal in Asia, that does not mean that women always have access or adequate health care during these times. For example, abortions in India have been legal since 1951 but women who are particularly poor or marginalized make up 50% of unsafe abortions. Women in the Philippines are more than likely to undergo an unsafe and unsanitary abortion causing around 1,000 death annually due to abortion complications.<ref name=":0" /> The Philippines along with Iraq and Laos are the countries that has not made abortion legal, excluding legal exceptions, therefore they have not made it available to where women can have admissions to legal abortions that are safe for them and their bodies. Countries such as Afghanistan, Thailand, China and Lebanon, have all been impacted by the determined long-term feminist motion by ASAP for women's abortion rights.

This work ranges from workshops, journalist, advocates to menstrual management, violence against women, and issues surrounded around unplanned pregnancies. "Youth champions" were created by ASAP to share the knowledge that they have learned to their peers about sexual activity, abortions, women's rights and reproductions, reproductive health, and the abortion rights movement in general. Youth champions have been trained directly by members of ASAP and have been very successful in their training that include issues around disability rights that can widen the interrelation research of the women's forces to help assimilate reproductive and sexual rights within the human rights movement.<ref name=":0" />

Chapter XXIX of the [[Penal Code of Japan]] makes abortion illegal in Japan. However, the [[:ja:母体保護法|Maternal Health Protection Law]] allows [[:ja:母体保護法指定医師|approved doctors]] to practice abortion with the consent of the mother and her spouse, if the pregnancy has [[Pregnancy from rape|resulted from rape]], or if the continuation of the pregnancy may severely endanger the maternal health because of physical reasons or economic reasons. Other people, including the mother herself, trying to abort the [[fetus]] can be punished by the law.

Abortion has been illegal in South Korea since 1953 but on April 11, 2019, South Korea's Constitutional Court ruled the abortion ban unconstitutional and called for the law to be amended.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sang-Hun |first1=Choe |title=South Korea Rules Anti-Abortion Law Unconstitutional |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/asia/south-korea-abortion-ban-ruling.html |work=The New York Times |date=April 11, 2019 }}</ref> The law stands until the end of 2020. The Constitutional Court has taken into consideration abortion-rights cases by women because they find the abortion ban as unconstitutional. To help support the legalization of abortion in South Korea, thousands of advocates compiled a petition for the Blue House to consider lifting the ban. Due to the abortion ban, this has led to many dangerous self-induced abortions and other illegal practices of abortion that needs more attention. This is why there are advocates challenging the law to put into perspective the negative factors this abortion ban brings. By making abortion illegal in South Korea, this also creates an issue when it comes to women's rights and their own rights to their bodies. As a result, many women's advocate groups were created and acted together to protest against the abortion ban law.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Economist |date=November 9, 2017 |title=A campaign to legalise abortion is gaining ground in South Korea |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/11/09/a-campaign-to-legalise-abortion-is-gaining-ground-in-south-korea |access-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>

{{Main|Abortion in Russia}}

In 1920, under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] became the first country in the world to legally permit abortion, no matter the circumstances.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Avdeev |first1=Alexandre |last2=Blum |first2=Alain |last3=Troitskaya |first3=Irina |date=1995 |title=The History of Abortion Statistics in Russia and the USSR from 1900 to 1991 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2949057 |journal=Population: An English Selection |volume=7 |pages=39–66 |jstor=2949057 |issn=1169-1018}}</ref>

But in the 20th century, the laws surrounding abortion were repeatedly modified between the years of 1936 and 1955. According to data from the United Nations in 2010, Russia had the highest rates of abortion per woman of reproduction. Results from the abortion rates of China and Russia were compared and out of a population of 1.3 billion people, China only reported 13 million abortions, a huge difference when contrasted to the population in Russia of 143 million people with 1.2 million abortions.{{CN|date=January 2023}} Since abortion was illegal in the Russian Empire, it was not recognized in the Domostroi. The Domostroi was a set of tasks that were to be followed that were structured around rules, instructions surrounded by religious, social and domestic issues that were centered within the Russian Society. These rules enforced respect and compliance to God and the church.

Different rulers had different views about abortion. During Romanov's reign, abortion was illegal, frowned up, and if a woman were to go through with an abortion, her punishment was death. But after Romanov's reign ended, Peter the Great lifted the punishment of death for abortions but it was still considered a serious issue in 1917. Before the punishment for abortions was death, according to the Russian Penal Code that dates back to 1462–1463, women were dispossessed of their basic human and civil rights and banned from the city or they were forced into hard labor.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Eurasia|first1=PONARS|title=Abortion in Russia: How Has the Situation Changed Since the Soviet Era? - PONARS Eurasia|url=https://www.ponarseurasia.org/abortion-in-russia-how-has-the-situation-changed-since-the-soviet-era/|access-date=April 9, 2021|website=www.ponarseurasia.org/|language=en-US}}</ref>

These harsh treatments and illegality surrounded around abortion still did not stop women from pursuing abortions. "Black Market" abortions were known as unauthorized and discreet procedures done by women who have experience in childbirth. These women were known as older women that were midwives and rural midwives, respectfully. Although these women were not abortion care providers, they were the only accessible obstetric personnel that women could go to without facing the harsh punishment and consequences forced upon by the Russian Society. Since adequate medical care was not provided for women looking to terminate their pregnancy, midwives and nurses from villages were trained to care for these women the best to their ability, but of course with illegal abortions there are always repercussions.

During the Soviet period in Russia, abortions ranked as the highest rates world-wide. After the Soviet period ended inn the Russian union, abortion numbers decreased with further enforced sex education courses and use of contraceptive birth control.

Abortion was illegal in the [[Republic of Ireland]] except when the woman's life was threatened by a medical condition (including risk of suicide), since [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|a 1983 referendum (aka 8th Amendment)]] amended the [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]]. Subsequent [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendments]] in 1992 (after the [[X Case]]) – the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|fourteenth]] – guaranteed the right to travel abroad (for abortions) and to distribute and obtain information of "lawful services" available in other countries. Two proposals to remove [[suicide]] risk as a ground for abortion were rejected by the people, [[Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1992|in a referendum in 1992]] and [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2002|in 2002]].

=== Middle East ===
Abortion laws in the Middle East reflect variation of opinions. Some countries permit abortion in cases involving a pregnant woman's well-being, fetal impairment, and rape. Abortion was widely practiced during the colonial period, and allowed a longer term termination. By the 19th century, progressive interpretations cut the abortion time limit down to the first trimester. However, a 2008 World Health Organization report estimated 900,000 unsafe abortion occurred each year in the Middle Eastern and Northern Africa regions. While many countries have decriminalized abortions and made it more accessible, there are still a few remaining countries yet to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Boston|first1=677 Huntington Avenue|last2=Ma 02115 +1495‑1000|date=December 9, 2019|title=EDITORIAL The Limits of the Law: Abortion in the Middle East and North Africa|url=https://www.hhrjournal.org/2019/12/editorial-the-limits-of-the-law-abortion-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/|access-date=March 24, 2021|website=Health and Human Rights|language=en-us}}</ref>

Because Argentina has been very restrictive against abortion, reliable reporting on abortion rates is unavailable. Argentina has long been a [[Religion in Argentina|strongly Catholic country]], and protesters seeking liberalized abortion in 2013 directed anger toward the Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.infobae.com/2013/11/26/1526476-en-san-juan-militantes-pro-aborto-quemaron-una-imagen-del-papa/|title=In San Juan, pro-abortion militants burned an image of the Pope (En San Juan, militantes pro aborto quemaron una imagen del Papa)|author1=Infobae.com Society Reporting staff|date=November 26, 2013|work=infobae.com|access-date=July 31, 2017|language=es|quote=Frente a la catedral, un grupo de católicos que hizo una muralla humana para evitar la profanación del templo debió soportar insultos, escupitajos y manchas de pintura.|archive-date=June 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627070223/http://www.infobae.com/2013/11/26/1526476-en-san-juan-militantes-pro-aborto-quemaron-una-imagen-del-papa/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Argentina is the home of the anti-violence organization [[Ni una menos]], which was formed in 2015 to protest the murder of Daiana García, which opposes the violation of a woman's right to choose the number and interval of pregnancies.<ref name="surcapitalino">{{cite web|url=http://www.surcapitalino.com.ar/detalle_noticias.php?Id=3598|title=Maratón de lectura contra los femicidios|date=March 26, 2015|publisher=Sur Capitalino|language=es|access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://niunamenos.com.ar/?page_id=16|title=Ley de protección integral para prevenir, sancionar y erradicar la violencia contra las mujeres.|website=niunamenos.com.ar|access-date=July 31, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805190211/http://niunamenos.com.ar/?page_id=16|archive-date=August 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Because of the ongoing discrimination that women face around the world, many organizations have come together and will come together to work and make efforts to equalize the rights and respect for women. ''Women's Autonomic, Equality and Reproductive Health and International Human Rights: Between Recognition, Backlash and Regressive Trends'' is a group that makes efforts towards the discrimination against women in law. This organization represents and advocates the rights of women to equality, dignity, and respect for her private life without discrimination. They have certain beliefs and outlooks towards humanitarian rights regarding termination of pregnancy at any time during the full pregnancy, and make aware that they believe the right of pregnant women to access termination of pregnancy should be autonomous affordable and effective. The fight for women's right, especially regarding her choice to abortion, has been an ongoing event with many negotiations, arguments, and exception. Overtime, many political figures have tried to contribute to the best of their ability to equalize women's rights, which surfaces the main discriminators of all women who seek out abortion. It is not limited to the political figures, but the women's peers, authorities, family, friends, coworkers, etc. Discrimination is not limited to law, and as this becomes more apparent, it is the goal of this movement, the Abortion Rights Movement, to allow women to choose discreetly what is best fitting for their lifestyle and their needs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nadine.|first=Cohen, Sherrill.
