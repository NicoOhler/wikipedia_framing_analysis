==Historical==
In the 19th century United States, [[Anthony Comstock]] launched an 'anti-vice crusade' that included opposition to contraception and abortion. He successfully got the [[US congress]] to pass laws later known as the [[Comstock laws]] that included provisions that made it illegal to send materials used for abortion through the mail.<ref> https://www.britannica.com/event/Comstock-Act, Encyclopedia Britannica, Comstock Act, retrieved August 24th 2023</ref> These laws have been referenced by modern anti-abortion campaigners in the US and cited in court cases to stop the mailing of abortion medication.<ref> https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/28/politics/comstock-act-abortion-ban-legal-fight/index.html, The 150-year-old chastity law that may be the next big fight over abortion, CNN, retrieved August 24th 2023</ref>

In Europe, abortion law varies by country, and has been legalized through parliamentary acts in some countries, and constitutionally banned or heavily restricted in others. In Western Europe this has had the effect at once of both more closely regulating the use of abortion, and at the same time mediating and reducing the impact anti-abortion campaigns have had on the law.<ref name="Outshoorn96">{{cite book|last=Outshoorn|first=Joyce|title=Abortion politics: public policy in cross-cultural perspective|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|editor=Marianne Givens|editor2=Dorothy M.

The first specifically anti-abortion organization in France, Laissez-les-vivre-SOS futures mères, was created in 1971 during the debate that was to lead to the [[Simone Veil#Minister of Health, 1974–1979|Veil Law]] in 1975. Its main spokesman was the geneticist [[Jérôme Lejeune]]. Since 2005, the French anti-abortion movement has organized an annual [[March for Life (Paris)|March for Life]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/19/thousands-take-part-in-paris-anti-abortion-march/|title=Thousands take part in Paris anti-abortion march|work=[[Euronews]]|date=19 January 2014|access-date=4 February 2016|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071435/http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/19/thousands-take-part-in-paris-anti-abortion-march/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

There are several major anti-abortion groups in the [[Republic of Ireland]], including [[Pro Life Campaign]], [[Youth Defence]] and the [[Iona Institute]]. The [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] (2018) provided for legal abortion in Ireland, but several anti-abortion parties still campaign, including [[Aontú]] and the [[National Party (Ireland, 2016)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/557212/protest-rally-in-limerick-as-abortion-figures-are-revealed.html|title=Protest rally in Limerick as abortion figures are revealed|website=www.limerickleader.ie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Quinn|first=David|date=2020-07-09|title=6,666 abortions in Ireland not treated as a big story|url=https://www.irishcatholic.com/6666-abortions-in-ireland-not-treated-as-a-big-story/|access-date=2021-08-13|website=The Irish Catholic|language=en-US}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the most prominent anti-abortion organization is the [[Society for the Protection of Unborn Children]]. It was formed at the time of the passage of the [[1967 Abortion Act]] which liberalized abortion law. The group campaigns against abortion, often using questionable claims,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/abortion-what-children-schools |title=Revealed: what children are being told about abortion |editor-last=Vasagar |editor-first=Jeevan |date=23 March 2012 |work=The Guardian |access-date=5 February 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> and supports protests at pregnancy clinics.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/13/anti-abortion-activism-clinic-vigil |title=Anti-abortion activism escalating, warns clinic targeted by vigil |last=Quinn |first=Ben |date=13 March 2012 |work=The Guardian |access-date=5 February 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The Abortion Act of 1967 had a significant effect in Britain (excluding Northern Ireland). The Act states that if at least two doctors deem the reasons for abortion to be in alignment with the Act, it can legally be performed. This still means that the punishment for women who obtain abortions contrary to the Act are faced with potential life imprisonment. Doctors too can be prosecuted if they are found administering abortions without reasonable cause.<ref name=":0" /> The Abortion Act of 1967 did not apply in [[Northern Ireland]]. Women living there who sought abortions either had to travel to Britain to receive an abortion or potentially face criminal charges for purchasing abortion pills illegally.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britsoc.co.uk/about/latest-news/2018/may/anti-abortion-activism-in-britain/|title=Anti-Abortion Activism in Britain|last1=Low|first1=Pam|last2=Page|first2=Sarah-Jane|date=May 2018}}</ref>

To this day, anti-abortion activists routinely stand outside many abortion clinics; their goal is to discourage women from entering the clinics. This is through two processes, known as "prayer vigils", which are sometimes quiet and other times said aloud to actively dissuade; and "pavement counseling", where activists approach women entering clinics in order to persuade them to continue with their pregnancies. This is a practice held in low regard by many, as it causes anxiety and distress.<ref name=":0" />

[[File:Anti-abortion protest, 1986.jpg|thumb|An anti-abortion protest outside an abortion clinic in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1986]]
The [[United States anti-abortion movement]] formed as a response to the landmark 1973 ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''  and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions with many [[List of anti-abortion organizations in the United States|anti-abortion organizations]] having emerged since then. There is also a smaller [[consistent life ethic]] movement, favoring a philosophy which opposes all forms of killing, including abortion, [[war]], [[euthanasia]], and [[capital punishment]].

The current movement is in part a continuation of previous debates on abortion that led to the practice being banned in all states by the late 19th century. The initial movement was led by [[physicians]], but also included politicians and [[feminists]]. Among physicians, advances in medical knowledge played a significant role in influencing anti-abortion opinion. [[Quickening]], which had previously been thought to be the point at which the soul entered a human was discovered to be a relatively unimportant step in fetal development, caused many medical professionals to rethink their positions on early term abortions.<ref name="Mohr">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|url=https://archive.org/details/abortioninameric00jame|url-access=registration|author=James C.

Meanwhile, many 19th-century feminists tended to regard abortion as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men.<ref>{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|url=https://archive.org/details/abortioninameric00jame|url-access=registration|first=James C.|last=Mohr|year=1978|page=[https://archive.org/details/abortioninameric00jame/page/110 110]|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-502249-0 }}</ref> The "free love" wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women.<ref name=Mohr112>{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|url=https://archive.org/details/abortioninameric00jame|url-access=registration|author=James C.

Anti-abortion groups like [[Focus on the Family]],<ref>Hilde Løvdal Stephens, ''Family Matters: James Dobson and Focus on the Family's Crusade for the Christian Home'', University of Alabama Press, US, 2019, p. 100</ref> [[Students for Life of America]], and [[Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America]] are considered part of the [[Christian right]]. They call themselves "pro-life" because they are often united in their belief that a [[fetus]] is a person that has legal rights. Since the U.S. Supreme Court decision [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization]], some of these organizations have turned their attention to banning abortions at the state and local level and asking the U.S. Supreme Court to recognize fetal personhood under the Constitution.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Honderich |first1=Holly |title=She helped kill Roe v Wade - now she wants to end abortion in America |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65923956 |access-date=23 June 2023 |publisher=BBC |date=22 June 2023}}</ref>
