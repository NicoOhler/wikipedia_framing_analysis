Policymakers\\nIntroduction\\nThis Report responds to the invitation for IPCC '... to provide a Special Report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways' contained in the Decision of the 21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to adopt the Paris Agreement.1\\nThe IPCC accepted the invitation in April 2016, deciding to prepare this Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.\", 'This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents the key findings of the Special Report, based on the assessment of the available scientific, technical and socio-economic literature2 relevant to global warming of 1.5°C and for the comparison between global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels.', 'The level of confidence associated with each key finding is reported using the IPCC calibrated language.3 The underlying scientific basis of each key finding is indicated by references provided to chapter elements.', 'In the SPM, knowledge gaps are identified associated with the underlying chapters of the Report.', 'A.', 'Understanding Global Warming of 1.5°C1\\nA.', '1 Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming2 above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C.', 'Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.', '(high confidence) (Figure SPM.1) {1.2}\\nA.1.1 Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) for the decade 2006-2015 was 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C)6 higher than the average over the 1850-1900 period (very high confidence).', 'Estimated anthropogenic global warming matches the level of observed warming to within ±20% (likely range).', 'Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1 °C and 0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions (high confidence).', '{1.2.1, Table 1.1,1.2.4}\\nA.1.2 Warming greater than the global annual average is being experienced in many land regions and seasons, including two to three times higher in the Arctic.', 'Warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean, (high confidence) {1.2.1,1.2.2, Figure 1.1, Figure 1.3,3.3.1,3.3.2}\\nA.1.3 Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence).', 'This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, including attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950.', '{3.3.1,3.3.2,3.3.3}\\n1 Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 21.', '2 The assessment covers literature accepted for publication by 15 May 2018.', '3 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement.', 'A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence.', 'The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99-100% probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66-100%, about as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%, very unlikely 0-10%, exceptionally unlikely 0-1 %.', 'Additional terms (extremely likely 95-100%, more likely than not >50-100%, more unlikely than likely 0-<50%, extremely unlikely 0-5%) may also be used when appropriate.', 'Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely.', 'This is consistent with AR5.', '4 See also Box SPM.1 : Core Concepts Central to this Special Report.', '5 Present level of global warming is defined as the average of a 30-year period centred on 2017 assuming the recent rate of warming continues.', '6 This range spans the four available peer-reviewed estimates of the observed GMST change and also accounts for additional uncertainty due to possible short-term natural variability.', '{1.2.1,Table 1.1}\\n\\nA.', '2 Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence).', '(Figure SPM.1) {1.2, 3.3, Figure 1.5}\\nA.2.1 Anthropogenic emissions (including greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors) up to the present are unlikely to cause further warming of more than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades (high confidence) or on a century time scale (medium confidence).', '{1.2.4, Figure 1.5}\\nA.2.2 Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic C02 emissions and declining net non-C02 radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales (high confidence).', 'The maximum temperature reached is then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic C02 emissions up to the time of net zero C02 emissions (high confidence) and the level of non-C02 radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are reached (medium confidence).', 'On longer time

from multiple lines of evidence.', 'A comprehensive  range of possible future air pollution controls in scenarios is used to consistently assess the effects of various  assumptions on projections of climate and air pollution.', 'A novel development is the ability to ascertain when  climate responses to emissions reductions would become discernible above natural climate variability,  including internal variability and responses to natural drivers.', 'D.1  From a physical science perspective, limiting human-induced global warming to a  specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2  emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Strong, rapid  and sustained reductions in CH4 emissions would also limit the warming effect resulting  from declining aerosol pollution and would improve air quality.', '{3.3, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, Box 5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1, 6.7, 7.6, 9.6} (Figure  SPM.10, Table

compared to AR5 and SR1.5.', 'This quantity is referred to as the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE).', 'This relationship implies that reaching net zero42 anthropogenic CO2 emissions is a requirement to stabilize human-induced global temperature increase at any level, but that limiting global temperature increase to a specific level would imply limiting cumulative CO2 emissions to within a carbon budget43.', '{5.4, 5.5, TS.1.3, TS.3.3, Box TS.5} (Figure SPM.10)  41 In the literature, units of °C per 1000 PgC are used, and the AR6 reports the TCRE likely range as

with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate  forcers.', 'This is referred to as the total carbon budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining  carbon budget when expressed from a recent specified date (see Glossary).', 'Historical cumulative CO2 emissions determine to a large  degree warming to date, while future emissions cause future additional warming.', 'The remaining carbon budget indicates how much  CO2 could still be emitted while keeping warming below a specific temperature level.', 'Figure

corresponding estimate of the historical human-caused surface warming (see  Figure SPM.2).', 'Coloured areas show the assessed very likely range of global surface temperature projections, and  thick coloured central lines show the median estimate as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions from 2020 until  year 2050 for the set of illustrative scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, see Figure  SPM.4).', 'Projections use the cumulative CO2 emissions of each respective scenario, and the projected global  warming includes the contribution from all anthropogenic forcers.', 'The relationship is illustrated over the domain of  cumulative CO2 emissions for which there is high confidence that the transient climate response to cumulative CO2  emissions (TCRE) remains constant, and for the time period from 1850 to 2050 over which global CO2 emissions  remain net positive under all illustrative scenarios as there is limited evidence supporting the quantitative  application of TCRE to estimate temperature evolution under net negative CO2 emissions.', 'Bottom panel: Historical and projected cumulative CO2 emissions in GtCO2 for the respective scenarios.',

estimated for several global temperature limits and various levels of probability, based on the estimated value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of historical warming, variations in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from thawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after global anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net zero.',

small.', 'When adjusted for emissions since previous reports, estimates of remaining carbon budgets are therefore of similar magnitude compared to SR1.5 but larger compared to AR5 due to methodological improvements44.', '{5.5, Box 5.2, TS.3.3} (Table SPM.2)  D.1.4  Anthropogenic CO2 removal (CDR) has the potential to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and durably store it in reservoirs (high confidence).', 'CDR aims to compensate for residual emissions to reach net zero CO2 or net zero GHG emissions or, if implemented at a scale where anthropogenic removals exceed anthropogenic emissions, to lower surface temperature.', 'CDR methods can have potentially wide-ranging effects on biogeochemical cycles and climate, which can either weaken or strengthen the potential of these methods to remove CO2 and reduce warming, and can also influence water availability and quality, food production and biodiversity45 (high confidence).', '{5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1, TS.3.3}  D.1.5  Anthropogenic CO2 removal (CDR) leading to global net negative emissions would lower the atmospheric CO2 concentration and reverse surface ocean acidification (high confidence).', 'Anthropogenic CO2 removals and emissions are partially compensated by CO2 release and uptake respectively, from or to land and ocean carbon pools (very high confidence).', 'CDR would lower atmospheric CO2 by an amount approximately equal to the increase from an anthropogenic emission of the same magnitude (high confidence).', 'The atmospheric CO2 decrease from anthropogenic CO2 removals could be up to 10% less than the atmospheric CO2 increase from an equal amount of CO2 emissions, depending on the total amount of CDR (medium confidence).', '{5.3, 5.6, TS.3.3}  D.1.6  If global net negative CO2 emissions were to be achieved and be sustained, the global CO2-induced surface temperature increase would be gradually reversed but other climate changes would continue in their current direction for decades to millennia (high confidence).', 'For instance, it would take several centuries to millennia for global mean sea level to reverse course even under large net negative CO2 emissions (high confidence).', '{4.6, 9.6, TS.3.3}  In the five illustrative scenarios, simultaneous changes in CH4, aerosol and ozone precursor  D.1.7  emissions, that also contribute to air pollution, lead to a net global surface warming in the near and long-term (high confidence).', 'In the long term, this net warming is lower in scenarios assuming air pollution controls combined with strong and sustained CH4 emission reductions (high confidence).', 'In the low and very low GHG emissions scenarios, assumed reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions lead to a net warming, while reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursor emissions lead to a net cooling.', 'Because of the short lifetime of both CH4 and aerosols, these climate effects partially counterbalance each other and reductions in CH4 emissions also contribute to improved air quality by reducing global surface ozone (high confidence).', '{6.7, Box TS.7} (Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1)  44 Compared to AR5, and when taking into account emissions since AR5, estimates in AR6 are about 300–350 GtCO2 larger for the  remaining carbon budget consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C; for 2°C, the difference is about 400–500 GtCO2.', '45 Potential negative and positive effects of CDR for biodiversity, water and food production are methods-specific, and are often  highly dependent on local context, management, prior land use, and scale.', 'IPCC Working Groups II and III assess the CDR potential,  and ecological and socio-economic effects of CDR methods in their AR6 contributions.', 'D.1.8  Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions is a requirement for stabilizing CO2-induced global surface  temperature increase, with anthropogenic CO2 emissions balanced by anthropogenic removals of CO2.', 'This  is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions  equal metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG removals.', 'For a given GHG emission pathway, the pathways of  individual greenhouse gases determine the resulting climate response46, whereas the choice of emissions  metric47 used to calculate aggregated emissions and removals of different GHGs affects what point in time  the aggregated greenhouse gases are calculated to be net zero.', 'Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net  zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential are projected to result in a decline in  surface temperature after an earlier peak (high confidence).', '{4.6, 7.6, Box 7.3, TS.3.3}      D.2  Scenarios with very low or low GHG emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) lead within   years to discernible effects on greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, and air  quality, relative to high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5).', 'Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible differences in trends of global surface  temperature would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years,  and over longer time periods for many other climatic impact-drivers (high confidence).', '{4.6, Cross-Chapter Box 6.1, 6.6, 6.7, 9.6, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, 11.2, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6,  12.4, 12.5} (Figure SPM.8, Figure SPM.10)     D.2.1  Emissions reductions in 2020 associated with measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 led to  temporary but detectible effects on air pollution (high confidence), and an associated small, temporary  increase in total radiative forcing, primarily due to reductions in cooling caused by aerosols arising from  human activities (medium confidence).', 'Global and regional climate responses to this temporary forcing are,  however, undetectable above natural variability (high confidence).', 'Atmospheric CO2 concentrations  continued to rise in 2020, with no detectable decrease in the observed CO2 growth rate (medium  confidence)48.', '{Cross-Chapter Box 6.1, TS.3.3}     D.2.2  Reductions in GHG emissions also lead to air quality improvements.', 'However, in the near term49,  even in scenarios with strong reduction of GHGs, as in the low and very low GHG emission scenarios  (SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9), these improvements are not sufficient in many polluted regions to achieve air  quality guidelines specified by the World Health Organization (high confidence).', 'Scenarios with targeted  reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years compared  to reductions in GHG emissions only, but from 2040, further improvements are projected in scenarios that  combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions with the magnitude of the benefit varying  between regions (high confidence).', '{6.6, 6.7, Box TS.7}.', '46 A general term for how the climate system responds to a radiative forcing (see Glossary).', '47 The choice of emissions metric depends on the purposes for which gases or forcing agents are being compared.', 'This report  contains updated emission metric values and assesses new approaches to aggregating gases.', '48 For other GHGs, there was insufficient literature available at the time of the assessment to assess detectable changes in their  atmospheric growth rate during 2020.', '49 Near term: (2021–2040)     D.2.3  Scenarios with very low or low GHG emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) would have rapid and  sustained effects to limit human-caused climate change, compared with scenarios with high or very high  GHG emissions (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5), but early responses of the climate system can be masked by natural  variability.', 'For global surface temperature, differences in 20-year trends would likely emerge during the near  term under a very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9), relative to a high or very high GHG emission  scenario (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5).', 'The response of many other climate variables would emerge from natural  variability at different times later in the 21st century (high confidence).', '{4.6, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Figure SPM.8, Figure SPM.10)    D.2.4  Scenarios with very low and low GHG emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) would lead to  substantially smaller changes in a range of CIDs36 beyond 2040 than under high and very high GHG  emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5).', 'By the end of the century, scenarios with very low and  low GHG emissions would strongly limit the change of several CIDs, such as the increase in the frequency  of extreme sea level events, heavy precipitation and pluvial flooding, and exceedance of dangerous heat  thresholds, while limiting the number of regions where such exceedances occur, relative to higher GHG  emissions scenarios (high confidence).', 'Changes would also be smaller in very low compared to low  emissions scenarios, as well as for intermediate (SSP2-4.5) compared to high or very high emissions  scenarios (high confidence).', '{9.6, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4, 12.5,  TS.4.3}']\n"
