### Label analysis

1. Comparison Newspapers
    + The values of the various newspapers are generally around the same level
    + Economic and Capacity is by far the most pronounced. Which also makes sense in relation to climate change, as this has a major impact on the economy. 
    + It is interesting that Health and Safty is low - but Quality of life has a higher score which may means that the articles are more likely to state that climate change is affecting our health in general than public safety    
    + Although the Financial Times has a special business focus, it ranks 2nd only to the Telegraph 
      + Financial Times has the lowest values at all labels (except Economics)

1. Comparison IGO NGO Newspapers
   + Newspapers generally use more “buzz words” - this may explain why they have a much greater value in all labels 
   + NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) have much higher economic and capacity values than IGOs ( Intergovernmental Organizations). Which is the opposite of what you would expect - since you would think government organizations would prioritize economics more than NGOs
   + The biggest difference in Newspapers vs. scientific articles can be seen in Public / Political. As you would expect, papers are written much less politically and have fewer opinions of the general public than a newspaper.
   + On the other hand, IGOs are more pronounced in Quality and Health.
   + With security, however, it is as you would expect - IGOs have a greater value than NGOs
