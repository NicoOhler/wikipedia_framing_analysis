### Label analysis

1. Comparison Newspapers
    + The values of the various newspapers are generally around the same level
    + Economic and Capacity is by far the most pronounced. Which also makes sense in relation to climate change, as this has a major impact on the economy. 
    + It is interesting that Health and Safty is low - but Quality of life has a higher score which may means that the articles are more likely to state that climate change is affecting our health in general than public safety    
    + Although the Financial Times has a special business focus, it ranks 2nd only to the Telegraph 
      + Financial Times has the lowest values at all labels (except Economics)

2. Comparison IGO NGO Newspapers
   + Newspapers generally use more “buzz words” - this may explain why they have a much greater value in all labels 
   + NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) have much higher economic and capacity values than IGOs ( Intergovernmental Organizations). Which is the opposite of what you would expect - since you would think government organizations would prioritize economics more than NGOs
   + The biggest difference in Newspapers vs. scientific articles can be seen in Public / Political. As you would expect, papers are written much less politically and have fewer opinions of the general public than a newspaper.
   + On the other hand, IGOs are more pronounced in Quality and Health.
   + With security, however, it is as you would expect - IGOs have a greater value than NGOs

3. Comparison Left Right
   + With the economic label, the order is as expected - the highest values from the right, then center before center-left
   + In the case of security, which refers among other things to “threats to the nation”, the order is also plausible. Right-wing media have the lowest value, followed by center. Center left sees climate change as the greatest threat.
   + At Quality - of life, the order is a little different. Center has the lowest value followed by right and center-left. The reason that the order is not the same as for Security could be that right-wing media report more on the fact that people feel restricted in their personal lives by climate protection measures and are therefore above center media. Center left media could write about how climate change impacts the Quality of life.

4. Comparison Press over Time
   + There is no recognizable pattern that has changed over the years. 
   + There has also been no particular change since the Paris Agreement was agreed (2015)

   + 2009 and 2017 are quite outliers for some labels in Political, Public, Quality, Security.
     + Assumption: 2009 - Leaked emails from the Climatic Research Unit were used by skeptics to claim data manipulation
     + 2017 - Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement.
     + These 2 events may have led to a more intense discussion of climate change in the journals.
