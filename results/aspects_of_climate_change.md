# Key Aspects of Climate Change

## Motivation

- we would like to create new framing labels more specific to climate change to find out who talks about what
  - which aspects are mostly talked about or neglected
    - e.g. natural disasters, rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity, economic consequences, ...
  - who focuses on what
    - e.g. does the FT talk more about economic consequences than other newspapers?
