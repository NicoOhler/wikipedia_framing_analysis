## Key Aspects of Climate Change
+ we would like to create new framing labels more specific to climate change to find out who talks about what
    + which aspects are mostly talked about or neglected
        + e.g. natural disasters, rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity, economic consequences, ...
    + who focuses on what
        + e.g. does the FT talk more about economic consequences than other newspapers?
+ these are just some ideas for now, we will refine them later
