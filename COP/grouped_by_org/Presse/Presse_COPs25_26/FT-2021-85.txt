We published content written by researchers, journalists, and activists, but we also wanted to bring our readers into the conversation. On our Instagram account @ftclimate, we asked people one question: How is climate change affecting your day-to-day decisions?  We heard from people who shared their experiences of living through extreme weather conditions, and others who told us about ways they had changed their lifestyles. Some readers said they had started living dairy-free and meat-free lives, while others said they had chosen to live child-free.  A number of readers said they had committed to changing their entire lifestyle, while others said they would be making small changes where they could.  We publish some responses below as well as on our social media platforms, and we encourage you to keep the conversation going.  Has climate change influenced your career choices? Have extreme weather events had an impact on your community? Let us know in the comments section.
