Parts of the region, including Co Durham and Tyne and Wear, have seen annual sunshine hours rise by more than 13 per cent since 1991 relative to the previous 30 years, compared with a rise of 5.6 per cent across the UK as a whole.  Met Office scientists said it was not clear why the North East had seen such an increase, nor whether it was attributable to man-made climate change.  Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office National Climate Information  Centre, said human-induced global warming was likely to be a "contributing factor". But he added that the increase could also be the result of a reduction in the use of aerosols, which increase cloud cover, and the natural variability of the weather in Britain.  The 30-year period from 1991 to 2020 will form the Met Office's new benchmark for measuring future changes to the UK climate.  Researchers found that the average temperature increased by 0.8C and rainfall by 7.3 per cent. High temperatures previously experienced mostly in the South are now more likely in the North of England and Scotland.  The statistics show that the UK is also experiencing fewer bouts of frost, with the number of days when the temperature drops below 0C falling by an average of 11.1.  "The result of human-induced cli mate change in the UK is that higher temperatures are felt further north than they used to be," said Dr McCarthy. "If you look at the average temperature, Hull has been warmer between 1991 and 2020 than Heathrow in London was between 1961 and 1990.  "So average temperatures previously limited to London and parts of the far South of England are now experienced as much as 155 miles further north."  But temperature and rainfall also showed significant variation, with parts of central and eastern England rising by more than 1C, and areas of Scotland seeing rainfall increase by 10 per cent.  Argyll and Bute saw the greatest increase in rainfall by volume, at over 200mm per year, compared with South Yorkshire with a rise of just over 14mm annually. Glasgow saw days with rainfall over 1mm increase by 12, compared with just one in Cambridgeshire.
