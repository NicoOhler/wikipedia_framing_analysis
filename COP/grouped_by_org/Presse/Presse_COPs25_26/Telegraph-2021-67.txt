Paulson to run Bono's climate change fund

By Lucy Burton

FORMER US Treasury secretary Henry Paulson has taken up an offer by Bono to run a fund focused on
combating climate change despite telling the U2 frontman last year that his "dance card is full".

Mr Paulson has agreed to run a new global fund with US private equity ﬁrm TPG, called TPG Rise Climate,
according to The New York Times, returning to the ﬁnance sector months after Bono ﬁrst approached him.
"He told me, 'My dance card is full'," Bono told the newspaper of the initial call last September. "I thought he'd
be amazing."

Bono and TPG ﬁrst teamed up ﬁve years ago when the U2 singer began advising on "impact" investments.
Mr Paulson's move to TPG means he is returning to the ﬁnance sector for the ﬁrst time since he left Goldman
Sachs in 2006. Eschewing publicity, his rise to the top of Goldman Sachs was little noticed until he became
chairman and chief executive in 1999.

While at Goldman and the Treasury, his passion for the environment caused controversy among global
warming sceptics, particularly after he became chairman of an organisation buying land to stop it from
being developed.
