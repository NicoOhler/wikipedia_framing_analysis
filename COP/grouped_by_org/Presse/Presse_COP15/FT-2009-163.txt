Mandelson warms to action on climate
By Jean Eaglesham, Chief Political Correspondent

Mainstream politics is entering a "precarious time" in the UK, with "pretty high" levels of cynicism and scepticism, Lord Mandelson will warn today.

The Blairite business secretary will use a speech on climate change to argue that the issue can be tackled effectively only through the political system.

Rebuilding political trust in Britain matters not just for its own sake but because "politics is the only way that we will be able to legitimately make the huge decisions that need to be made now" to tackle climate change, Lord Mandelson will say.

Labour has failed to provide sufficient strategic direction on energy policy for most of its time in office, the business secretary will admit.

"Up until recently there has been too much ambiguity or uncertainty in UK climate policy - in nuclear energy or renewables, for example," he will say. "Clear leadership on these questions over the course of the last year has now unlocked billions of pounds of investment in UK capacity. We need to get that sense of clear strategic direction right through our action as a government."

The broad political approach to climate change needs to stress the economic opportunities, as well as the costs, the business secretary will assert.

In a joking reference to his encounter with a protester, Lord Mandelson will say that mainstream environmental politics can inherit the "passion and urgency" of green campaigners. "But it obviously can't be totally anti-politics, anti-business and anti-growth - we can't just throw green slime at the problem."
