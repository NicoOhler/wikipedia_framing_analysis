The Daily Telegraph (London, UK) Monday, March 31, 2014, p. 1Climate change threat to British food pricesBy Emily Gosden, Energy EditorBRITAIN faces water shortages and food price increases as well as floods and deadly heatwaves as a result of climate change, a report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds today.Other parts of the world will be even harder hit and less able to adapt, the IPCC warns.Food shortages and poverty could lead to the outbreak of war, the report says. It also suggests that people will be forced to flee areas that become too warm, while some species of wildlife face the risk of extinction.The more temperatures rise, the more severe the consequences will be and the harder it will become for people to adapt, the report finds.Warming by 4C (7.2F) from preindustrial levels will lead to a "fundamentally different" world from today, whereas limiting warming to 2C (3.6F) by cutting emissions will result in a world "not dramatically different", said Chris Field, of the IPCC working group which wrote the report."With high levels of warming that result from continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, risks will be challenging to manage, and even serious, sustained investments in adaptation will face limits," he said.Ed Davey, Britain's Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said that "left unchecked, climate change will have far reaching consequences for our society"."This evidence builds the case for early action in the UK and around the world to lessen the risks posed by climate change," he said. "We cannot afford to wait."
