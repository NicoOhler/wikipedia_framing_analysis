Telegraph (London, UK) Tuesday, October 5, 2010THREE EXPERTS SHARE THEIR VIEWS ON HOW BUSINESS AND WIDER SOCIETY MUST FACE UP TO THE ENERGY CHALLENGES AHEADALAIN GLATIGNY, Innovation Energy Manager, Schneider ElectricDR SULTAN AL JABER, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the major cleantech development company, Masdar, UAEMATTHEW CHINN, Managing Director Siemens Energy Sector and Sector Lead, North West EuropeQ: WHAT ARE THE DD7FICULTIES OF INTEGRATING RENEWABLE ENERGY INTO THE GRID? A: Europe's leaders are committed to the 20-20-20 targets on climate and energy use. Integrating energy from renewable sources is one of the main technical challenges. Renewable energy is unpredictable and it is difficult to match supply with demand, which makes the planning of the grid dispatcher more complex.Renewable energy creates a bi-directional flow which has implications for network protection, voltage regulation and islanding. The key challenge is to find affordable solutions which will allow the integration of any type of renewable energy at any location on the grid and provide the means to control the load, depending on the available power. Q: WHY IS NETWORK STABILITY IMPORTANT AND HOW CAN IT BE ACHIEVED? A: A high rate of renewable energy distributed on the grid coupled with changes in customer usage can create instability on a network.The result could be black-outs, regionally or nationally, which is obviously bad for the economy. Network stability can be controlled on two levels: at transmission level, and at distribution level, by controlling the loads and distributed generators. So ancillary services which contribute to network stability, such as active-reactive power management, will definitely become more valuable.Q: WHAT IS 'DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT' AND HOW DOES IT AFFECT THE NEED FOR NETWORK MANAGEMENT? A: Demand side management (DSM) means taking actions which respond to how much energy is consumed and also to the pattern of use. It can mean, for example, taking steps to reduce demand at peak times. It requires an efficient communications infrastructure to link the demand, supply and market sides. It's a great opportunity for operators to make more intelligent use of existing assets, using 'smart grid' technologies, such as grid automation and networking management. www.schneider-electric.com NATIONS TOGETHER AND CO-ORDINATING POLICY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY? A: The leadership of Abu Dhabi realise the importance renewable energy will play in meeting future global energy needs.Through Masdar, Abu Dhabi has invested in a strategic and comprehensive initiative dedicated to all aspects of renewable energy. Masdar, through global partnerships and collaboration, is making significant advances in the areas of energy security, climate change and sustainable human development. Events such as the European Future Energy Forum and the annual World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi serve as ideal platforms for Masdar to secure long-term strategic partners for the joint development of renewable energy technologies.Q: WHAT AREAS OF POTENTIAL CO-OPERATION ARE THERE BETWEEN MASDAK AND EUROPE, PARTICULARLY THE UK?A: In Europe our focus is mainly on developing cooperation across R&D, venture capital investments in cleantech and climate-change mitigation plans, as well as large scale deployment of renewable energy technology.The London Array, a joint venture between DONG, E.ON and Masdar, will be the world's largest wind farm, providing enough energy to power around 750,000 homes in Greater London, around a quarter of the total.Q: HOW WILL THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY MOVE FORWARD IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS?A: Clean energy has the ability to mitigate climate change, establish new economic sectors, revive failing economic sectors and help meet global energy requirements without sacrificing economic growth and human progress.Q:WHY IS THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES A GOOD PLACE TO INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS?A: There is no equivalent to Masdar anywhere, either in scale as a test-bed or hi the comprehensive nature of the approach. Masdar offers an unparalleled investment portfolio with access to human capital and R&D capabilities, entirely dedicated to clean energy solutions. www. masdar. ae www. worldfutureenergysummit .com ENERGY INDUSTRY IN A LOW-CARBON FUTURE?A: To decarbonise energy generation rapidly while maintaining energy security. Electricity consumption is expected to rise by more than 60 per cent by 2030 and our new generating capacity will need to be a mixture of technologies, such as wind power, nuclear, clean coal and biomass.Q: HOW CAN NEW TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY HELP ADOPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES? A: New transmission technologies such as high voltage direct current (HVDC) enable electricity to be moved across longer distances with up to 40 per cent fewer losses than AC technologies.This allows the industry to generate electricity in more remote locations and efficiently transmit it to where it is needed. So for wind energy, where Siemens provides more than 40 per cent of wind turbine generating capacity in the UK, HVDC technology will enable wind farms to be established further offshore.Q: HOW CAN THE GROWTH IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION BE MANAGED EFFICIENTLY?A: Smart grid applications will help manage future consumption. For example, digital smart meters tell consumers when they are using high-cost electricity, so they can adjust their consumption and use less power at peak times and save money. Trials with smart meters have demonstrated that consumers and business users become highly motivated to save electricity when they know how much they are using from moment to moment.Q: WHAT CHANGES CAN WE EXPECT TO THE ENERGY SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE FUTURE?A: Undoubtedly e-cars and smart grid applications will be the greatest changes. Besides changing the way we travel, e-cars could also be used to help balance electricity peak supply and demand. The batteries in e-cars could be used to store electricity during periods of low demand and if the car is not being used, the electricity could be released into the grid during periods of high demand. www.siemens.co.uk
