Telegraph (London, UK) Friday, November 19, 2010TAXPAYERS' CASH GOES ON SOLAR PANELS FOR AFRICALouise GrayMILLIONS of pounds of British taxpayers' money is to be spent on solar panels and wind turbines in Africa and Asia as part of a drive to help poor countries by developing green businesses.Andrew Mitchell, the International Development Secretary, said yesterday that aid money would be used in a new way to tackle climate change, as well as funding health and education. The Coalition is planning to invite private investment in green development projects that could create jobs and reduce carbon dioxide.Aid agencies and charities say there is a danger in involving big business in aid because they claim they will only help people while there is the potential for profit.Mr Mitchell announced two public-private partnership projects in Africa and Asia to stimulate investment in renewable energy schemes.The Coalition has put aside GBP2.9 billion of the aid budget to fight climate change over the next four years.From this, grants for public-private renewable energy projects will be put in a central pot and added to by private investors. Companies can then dip into the fund to develop green schemes.Kirsty Wright, from the World Development Movement, said: "The UK Government is once again ignoring the voices of people in the developing world and prioritising the needs of big business."
