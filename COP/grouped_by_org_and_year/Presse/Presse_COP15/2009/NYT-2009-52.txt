Gore Revisits Climate Crisis In New Book
Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

Al Gore will return to the subject of global warming in a book to be released by Rodale, the publisher said in a news release. The book, "Our Choice," will return to the milieu of Mr. Gore's 2006 best seller, "An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It." In a statement, Mr. Gore said the book would offer plans for addressing the climate crisis while creating jobs and promoting economic growth that were developed through meetings he held with scientists, engineers and policy experts. Rodale said that the book would be published on Nov. 3 and would be printed on 100 percent recycled paper, with all proceeds being donated to the nonprofit Alliance for Climate Protection.
