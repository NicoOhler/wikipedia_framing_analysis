Climate Change Poses Threat to Synchrony Of Shrimp and Its Food
By Henry Fountain

One concern about climate change is its potential for disrupting the delicate timing that exists within ecosystems. If warmer temperatures cause a bird to migrate earlier in the spring, for example, it might arrive before there are enough insects for food.

Using data from ocean surveys and remote-sensing satellites, Peter Koeller of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and colleagues have revealed a similar potential for disruption in a marine ecosystem involving northern shrimp. In a paper in Science, the researchers show that the development and hatching of the shrimp eggs throughout the North Atlantic closely match the spring bloom of phytoplankton, which the shrimp live on.

They found that the temperature of the water on the ocean bottom, which varies by latitude, determines the length of the development period and hatching times for the shrimp (from about 6 months in warmer areas to 10 months in colder spots).

The timing of the phytoplankton bloom varies too, due to the amount of sunlight and water temperatures nearer the surface. But almost everywhere, over the long term, the eggs hatch as the bloom peaks, providing an abundance of food for the larval shrimp.

It would not take much to disrupt this synchrony, the researchers say. If sea surface temperatures increased over time (as atmospheric temperatures increased), the bloom might happen earlier. Similarly, if bottom temperatures changed, the eggs would hatch sooner or later, before the full phytoplankton bloom.
