MPs reach climate bill deal on transport
By Alex Barker, Political Correspondent

A compromise deal has been reached to include shipping and aviation in the climate change bill after ministers bowed to pressure from backbench MPs and environmental campaigners.

Under the deal, the government will "take account" of shipping and aviation as it plans to meet emission reduction targets, but leaves the method of measurement to be set in coming years.

The concession by Ed Miliband, energy secretary, is likely to defuse a growing revolt in the House of Commons and ease the passage of a bill setting a target to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.

Ministers initially resisted including aviation and shipping in the bill because there was no agreed method for allocating emissions from international transport.

Friends of the Earth welcomed the change of tack to close what they regarded as a loophole in the law.

"The final piece of the jigsaw is in place. The world's first climate change law will also be a world-class climate change law," said Andy Atkins, chief executive.

More than 50 Labour MPs, including a former environment minister, had signed a parliamentary amendment demanding that aviation and shipping be included.

The government will accept an amendment by Elliot Morley tomorrow, stating that "the emissions of greenhouse gases from international aviation or international shipping" will be taken into account by ministers setting "carbon bud-gets".

"We're bringing forward the date by which these emissions should be included in those covered by the bill to the end of 2012," said an aide to Mr Miliband.
