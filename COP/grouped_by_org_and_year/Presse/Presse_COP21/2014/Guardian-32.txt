The Guardian (UK) Wednesday, September 24, 2014 - 00:01 UTC -0400Heroes and villains in the fight against climate changeAubrey Meyer (@aubreygci)The New Climate Economy report from Nicholas Stern et al at the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate (Cutting emissions can boost growth, say economists, 16 September) says "Good economic actions can take us most of the way to a 2C path". This is from the economist who had the grace to admit he got it so wrong before. However, the emissions context in which this new claim is made is a little heroic. It is based on climate modelling in the IPCC fifth assessment report, which, as Nicholas Stern himself observed from the IMF last May, omitted significant feedback effects.We seem now to be entering an era of carefully scripted half-truths, where the glass half full is a different glass from the one that is half empty. The half-truths that nudge this "New Climate Economy" still do not observe the limits that make it a wholly owned subsidiary of the global environment. Sadly, one is inclined to take these half-truths with the salt in the seawater that's coming our way.
