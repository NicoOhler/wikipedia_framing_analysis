Letter: Plastic straws and the climate change camel

I disagree with Bill Gates that to stop buying plastic straws is not a worthwhile behavioural change for
individuals seeking to support responsible consumption ("Bill Gates: My Green manifesto", Life & Arts, FT
Weekend, February 20).

This response exempliﬁes an inherent bias in the ongoing global discourse that has resulted in net zero
carbon emissions being equated to (or seen as a substitute for) the much wider objective of sustainable
development.

This is not to argue that net zero is not a critical goal, but its dominance of the sustainability narrative will
end up doing incalculable harm to the cause of other equally important sustainability challenges facing the
world.

For   instance,   environmental   pollution,   plastic   waste   and   water   stress   may   be   much   more   localised
challenges and thus not able to command the same global attention as climate change. But their impacts
can be equally damaging and far more immediate.

India's top six cities had more than 120,000 deaths in 2020 attributed to elevated levels of PM2.5 pollution, the
particles which are about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair and can penetrate deep into the lungs.

More than 6bn tonnes or 80 per cent of all plastics produced in the world has been dumped into landﬁlls or
the natural environment, including oceans.

A quarter of the world's population is already facing extreme water stress, according to World Resources
Institute.

What we need, therefore, is an "all of the above" approach to achieve the 17 targets forming part of the UN
sustainable development goals framework.

The correct response from Gates would be to wholeheartedly encourage responsible consumption, including
not using or buying plastics straws.
