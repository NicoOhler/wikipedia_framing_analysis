Scientists at the Louisiana State University weighed and measured 15,000 individual birds from 77 different species, including the Amazonian Motmot and the thrush-like Antpitta.  On average, researchers found the birds were 8 per cent lighter than 40 years ago, down from 30g to 27.6g.  Longer wings and smaller bodies enable the birds to flap less and in turn use less energy and keep cool.  Experts warn that if the birds cannot keep rapidly adapting to the increase in global temperatures then they could be driven to extinction.  The study in Science Advances is the first to discover the trend in non-migratory birds.  Ecologist Vitek Jirinec, who led the study, said: "Even in the middle of this pristine Amazon rainforest, we are seeing the global effects of climate change caused by people, including us."  Prof Philip Stouffer, co-author, explained: "These birds don't vary much in size. When everyone in the population is a couple of grams smaller, it is significant."
