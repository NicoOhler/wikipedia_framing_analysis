Inﬂuencers targeted to boost climate forum

By Olivia Rudgard environmental correspondent

ENGAGING the youth is a constant struggle for politicians - and the UK's upcoming climate change summit
is seeking expertise in a novel area.

The Cabinet Ofﬁce is searching for someone to persuade social media inﬂuencers to help it promote the
international COP26 environment conference in Glasgow in November.

The £65,000, one-year contract for a "relationship manager - inﬂuencers and civil society" asks for someone
to be the "primary focal point for all the inﬂuencers we work with". The hire, set to begin work in March,
would "manage partnerships with high-proﬁle inﬂuencers around the globe to promote COP26 and climate
action. You will identify events and other opportunities to publicly promote COP26 and climate action,
tailored to the proﬁle of each individual, drawing on the support of our diplomatic network".

The conference has previously engaged Blackpink, the South Korean pop group, to publicise the event,
which was due to take place last year.

Blackpink, who have popularised the genre "K-pop" around the world, have a strong audience among young
people and are the most followed girl group on

Spotify.   In   Instagram   and   Twitter   messages   last   month,   the   group   said   climate change   was   a   "global
challenge" and admitted that they were "not experts, and we're not fully aware of all the issues, but we do
care about our planet and we want to learn more".

Earlier this week, Full Fact, the factchecking charity, found £63,000 had been spent paying 42 social media
inﬂuencers to post on Instagram about the Government's Covid-19 Test and Trace service. A Freedom of
Information   request   found   that   celebrities   including   those   from   the   reality   TV   show   Love   Island   and
professional sports players had been paid to promote the scheme.
