Prince urges fund managers to ﬁght global warming

By Rachel Millard

THE Prince of Wales has urged major institutional investors to use their ﬁnancial ﬁre power to help cut
carbon emissions.

He said the "climate crisis" was "rapidly becoming a catastrophe that will dwarf the impact of the coronavirus
pandemic". He added: "I am very glad to know that the global investment community is responding to the
urgency of the situation we face...

"The global ﬁre power of institutional investors must be harnessed and directed towards a net-zero future."

The Prince made the comments in a foreword to a new blueprint to help fund managers pick assets that will
slow down global warming.

The Net Zero Investment Framework is being launched today by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate
Change. The IIGCC said 35 investors are now using the framework to guide their decisions, including Scottish
Widows, Royal London and Legal and General Investment Management.
