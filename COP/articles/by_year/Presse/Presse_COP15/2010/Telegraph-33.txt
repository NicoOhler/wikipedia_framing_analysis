Telegraph (London, UK) Thursday, April 1, 2010MILIBAND TURNS UP THE HEAT ON CHINALouise Gray Environment CorrespondentED MILIBAND, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, yesterday attempted to break the deadlock on international - negotiations by making a major concession to poor countries, including China.A United Nations summit in Copenhagen at the end of last year broke down because rich and poor countries could not agree the best way to cut greenhouse gas emissions.The main problem was that developing countries wanted an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, that imposed targets on rich nations, while developed countries wanted a new treaty.Mr Miliband said both could be done at once.He said Britain and other countries were willing to sign a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012, as long as poor nations such as China agreed to cut their emissions.The move is a clear attempt to force the United States and China, the world's two biggest emitters, to sign up to some sort of legally-binding agreement to tackle climate change at a UN meeting in Mexico next year -- even if it means having separate treaties.Unveiling Beyond Copenhagen, the Government's action plan on climate change, Mr Miliband said: "We do not want to let a technical argument about whether we have one treaty or two derail the process."We are determined to show flexibility as long as there is no undermining of environmental principles." At the same time Gordon Brown was meeting other world leaders to push for a multi-billion pound fund to help poor countries cope with climate change.The talks in London looked at ways to raise GBP66billion a year by 2020.Ideas to be discussed include a "Robin Hood tax" on banking transactions and a tax on aviation and shipping.
