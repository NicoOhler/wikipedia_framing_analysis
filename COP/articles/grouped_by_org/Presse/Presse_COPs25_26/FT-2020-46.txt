Nuns lambast BlackRock over climate change

Attracta Mooney A group of Catholic nuns has taken aim at BlackRock's record on climate change, adding their voice to a growing chorus including Al Gore that claim the biggest fund manager is not doing enough.

Mercy Investment Services, the investment programme of the Sisters ofMercy of the America.s, lambasted the $7tn asset manager's voting record on climate change resolutions at the annual meetings of companies inwhichit invests.

The sisters have filed a motion ahead of BlackRock's annual meeting next year, calling for the asset manager to review its voting policies related to climate change.Theresolution has been co-filed by more than 10 other BlackRock shareholders, including several religious groups.

Mercy Investment Services said that in 2019 BlackRock supported only six of 52 climate-related resolutions, such as requests for enhanced disclosure of carbon emissions or those calling for an adoption of greenhouse gas reduction goals. This is despite BlackRock's own research suggesting climate change poses a risk to investmentreturns.

In the resolution, Mercy Investment Services said that the asset manager's voting practices "appear continued on page2 FTfm is taking a two-week print breakandwillbebackonJanuary6 inconsistent with its statements about climate change", posing a reputational risk for the company with both clients and investors. "Proxy voting practices that ignore climate change seem to ignore significant company-specific and economy-wide risks associated with negative impacts of climate change," the resolution said.

"We believe it is BlackRock's fiduciary responsibility to review how climate change impacts â€¦ portfolio companies, evaluate how specific shareholder resolutions on climate may impact shareholder value, and vote accordingly."

A similar resolution was filed for the 2017 annual meeting, which was later withdrawn by shareholders after engagement with BlackRock. However, shareholders said there had been "woefully inadequate progress" since then on climate voting, leading to this new shareholder motion.

BlackRock said it would speak to the filers of the resolution. It added its stewardship team had "engaged with 370 companies globally on a range of environmental topics", including the business impact of a shift to a lower-carbon economy. "Where companies have not responded to our engagement or where we do not see progress,[the] Black-Rock investment stewardship [team] continues to vote against directors and, where relevant, for shareholder proposals," the company said.
