Citizens' assembly on climate crisis to hold first meeting

Net zero
CAMILLA HODGSON

bly will begin in Birmingham on Saturday, where 110 UK citizens will gather to thrash out solutions for reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

A citizens' assembly for climate change, convened over two months at a cost of £520,000, will discuss how to meet the government's legally binding goal. The participants, selected to reflect the make-up of the UK population, will aim to produce a series of non-binding recommendations for parliament about how to decarbonise sectors such as transport and housing.

"The citizens' assembly on climate change gives people a say on how the UK tackles climate change," said Rachel Reeves MP, former chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, one of the six House of Commons select committees that commissioned and part-funded the project. The first weekend is an educational meeting, where participants will learn about the climate crisis. Options for reaching net zero by 2050, such as taxing frequent flyers, will then be chosen by the participants from a range being drawn up by four experts.

The specific questions and potential solutions to be debated — which will be considered by a 19-strong advisory panel and the six select committees — will then be made public.

Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion said the goal should be 2025. It said the assembly lacked teeth, since ministers can "completely ignore" the advisory report, due in April.

Of the 30,000 people invited at random to take part, 2,000 agreed. The final 110 assembly members were chosen by computer to reflect the population, based on age, gender, ethnicity, education, where they live and their level of concern about climate change.

Craig Bennett, outgoing head of Friends of the Earth, said the assembly "could play an important role" in decarbonising the UK, but should not "delay things further".
