Skewers out for 'climate risk' beach barbecues

By Daily Telegraph Reporter

BARBECUES could be banned on Brighton's beaches after the "woke" city council said they contributed to
climate change.

The council has come under Ô¨Åre over the proposal to stop people enjoying barbecues on all beaches, parks
and open spaces in the area.

The Green Party-run authority said that disposable barbecues are partly to blame for the world's rising CO2
levels. It says the move is part of the direction for action on climate change with the aim of making the
seaside resort carbon neutral by 2030.

The plans have been condemned by residents and tourists alike who have accused the Green-run council of
being "the worst type of woke" and trying to kill the summer tourism trade.

One said: "The insanity on banning barbecues is just unbelievable. This will make zero difference."

The council said the proposals were in their very early stages as part of a raft of environmental schemes
under consideration and would go to a consultation.
