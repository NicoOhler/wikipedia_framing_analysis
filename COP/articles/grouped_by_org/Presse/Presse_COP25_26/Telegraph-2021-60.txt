France guilty of missing climate change targets

By Henry Samuel in Paris

A FRENCH court has found the state guilty of inaction in ﬁghting climate change, in a landmark ruling that
environmentalists have dubbed the case of the century.

The verdict yesterday was an embarrassment for Emmanuel Macron, the president, as it suggested his
administration was failing in its stated promise to "make our planet great again".

In what is seen as the ﬁrst major "climate trial" in France, judges at the administrative court in Paris ruled
that the state had displayed "culpable failure" by not meeting its goals.

Greenhouse gas emissions in France fell by 0.9 per cent in 2019, well below the annual target of 1.5 per cent,
which is due to rise to 3.2 per cent from 2025.

Juliette Binoche and Marion Cotillard, the actresses who are among celebrity supporters of the campaign,
published a video shouting, "We won!"

The court ordered the state to pay a symbolic €1 to the non-governmental organisations behind the lawsuit.
Judges   will   now   decide   whether   to   order   the   state   to   take   extra   measures   to   honour   its   climate
commitments.
