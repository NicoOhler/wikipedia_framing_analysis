Telegraph (London, UK) Wednesday, September 15, 2010CLIMATE GATE INQUIRIES WERE FLAWED, SAYS LAWSONLouise Gray Environment CorrespondentA "HUGE cloud of doubt" remains over the case for man-made global warming, according to Lord Lawson of Blaby, following a new analysis of the "climategate" scandal.Sceptics claim emails stolen from the University of East Anglia last year showed scientists were willing to manipulate data to show a rise in global temperatures since the industrial era. Three official inquiries were launched by the university and the House of Commons that concluded the scientists did nothing wrong.But a report by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank set up by Lord Lawson, now claims that the inquiries were "rushed and seriously inadequate".Lord Lawson said the "defective" nature of the inquiries left doubts about the science behind proof of man-made global warming."When the UEA emails were leaked it cast a huge cloud of doubt over the whole issue of climate change," he said. "This was why the inquiries were set up, to allay that doubt. But the defective nature of the inquiries [means that] from the point of view of the public, these inquiries have not succeeded in putting to rest the concerns."The emails showed Prof Phil Jones, the head of the Climatic Research Unit, refusing to give information about climate change data and discussing plans to alter charts.The House of Commons science and technology committee, a study by Lord Oxburgh and an independent inquiry by Sir Muir Russell, a former senior civil servant, all found the UEA science was sound, although the university was criticised for lack of transparency.A report for Lord Lawson's think tank by Andrew Mont-ford, a well known blogger, said the inquiries failed to ask the opinions of sceptics. He also said they failed to probe allegations of fraud in scientific papers.
