Malaria-like illness in UK 'due to global warming'

By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

BRITAIN had its ﬁrst case of a tickborne disease similar to Lyme last summer - a parasite with malaria-like
symptoms known as "babesiosis" - thought to be due to climate change.

Illnesses more often associated with warmer climates will become more common as temperatures get
hotter and wetter, a report from the WWF and other charities, including Oxfam and the National Trust, say.

"The UK is at risk of the spread of infectious diseases like dengue fever, Lyme disease and West Nile fever -
which is already present in some European countries - and from an increase in cholera infections from
warming seawaters in Europe. The vectors of these diseases are mosquitoes, sand ﬂies and ticks," the report
says.

Lyme disease, which can cause longterm heath problems such as joint inﬂammation and cognitive issues, is
increasingly being caught in gardens and parks as well as wilder places.

In 2016, the former England rugby player Matt Dawson had to have heart surgery after being bitten by a tick
in a

London park. Around 1,000 cases of Lyme are conﬁrmed in the UK each year, but the true number is thought
to be higher.

Last July marked the ﬁrst recorded UK-acquired case of babesiosis, a parasitic disease often found alongside
Lyme. It attacks red blood cells and causes fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, though scientists say
it has likely been in the UK for much longer. Many cases are asymptomatic, but deadly infections can occur
in the elderly or those with an impaired immune system.

Prof Richard Wall, a tick-borne-disease expert at Bristol University, said: "We think the changing climate will
have an impact on tick populations, but the evidence is really very difﬁcult to obtain, because we don't have
good historical surveillance."
