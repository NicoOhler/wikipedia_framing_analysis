A better way to tackle climate change

From Dr Kelly Sims Gallagher.

Sir, Jagdish Bhagwati is correct that creativity is needed to bridge differences between rich and poor countries on climate change ("A new approach to tackling climate change", February 23). While the World Trade Organisation offers some institutional alternatives, climate negotiators have already tried and failed to develop a compliance mechanism with teeth, and that is because political will for serious consequences is feeble.

Prof Bhagwati is right that rich countries need to be prepared to pay for past liability, but we need an even more creative mechanism for doing so that benefits rich and poor alike. I proposed a carbon mitigation fund in a recent paper whereby funds would be used to pay incremental costs of low-carbon technologies in developing countries. Contributions to the fund would be based on historical emissions.

The two caveats are that developing countries must have domestic policies to reduce emissions in order to access the fund, and companies from all countries must be allowed to compete to be technology providers for the new power plants, buildings and factories in developing countries. This way, companies from both developing and industrialised countries can compete for the new markets created by a low-carbon economy.
