EU heavy industry seeks 'certainty' on climate change
By NIKKI TAIT

Heavy industry in the European Union must be told as soon as possible whether it will continue to receive pollution permits for free, France and Germany have warned, writes Nikki Tait in Brussels.

Paris and Berlin are among seven capitals to have written to Brussels urging clarity on the overhaul of the bloc's emissions trading scheme. The move reflects the challenge raised by the EU's efforts to fight climate change and cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The letter, sent on Friday to both the European Commission and the Slovenian EU presidency, is signed by Christine Lagarde, France's economy minister, and Michael Glos, minister for economic affairs in Germany, among others.

Other supporters include Austria, Luxembourg, Finland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.

The countries say industries - especially those that are energy-intensive - need more clarity on their contribution to climate change measures.

"Medium and long-term investment planning requires certainty on the future framework as soon as possible," they say.
