China tells west to boost climate effort
By Geoff Dyer in Beijing

The developed world should abandon its "unsustainable lifestyle" and do more to help poor nations adapt to climate change, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, said yesterday.

The slowdown in the global economy caused by the financial crisis should not be allowed to hamper efforts to deal with global warming, said Mr Wen, and more technology should be transferred to poorer countries.

"It took developed countries several decades to solve the problems of saving energy and cutting emissions, while China has to solve the same problem in a much shorter period. So the difficulty is unprecedented," Mr Wen said at a UN-sponsored climate conference in Beijing. on climate change. "Developed countries should shoulder the duty and responsibility to tackle climate change and should alter their unsustainable lifestyle," he added. The comments reflect the more assertive tone that China has been taking in talks about climate change, especially given the expectation that a Barack Obama administration will shift the position of the US.

China has previously tended to play a secondary role on issues such as climate change. But with several research institutes calculating that China has overtaken the US to be the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - even though it is still well behind on a per capita basis - the government is worried that its record could become the focus of negotiations.

A senior European diplomat said: "Everyone is waiting to see what the new US administration does but China very much does not want to become a pariah on this issue. You will see them being more constructive and also trying to shift the argument much more."
