Though the northern shift was expected because of warming temperatures, researchers said the more surprising westward movement could be the result of a change in rainfall patterns.When researchers analyzed the impact of climate change, they found precipitation had a stronger impact on forests in the short term than temperatures, said lead author Songlin Fei of Purdue University.The eastern USA has gotten warmer over the past few decades, and the Southeast has trended drier.Fei said deciduous trees such as oak and maple primarily move west, and evergreens move north. Trees don't actually move, of course, but where they sprout can change. Saplings can expand into a region while older growth dies in another, The Atlanticreported.One of the more striking examples is the scarlet oak, which in nearly three decades has moved more than 127 miles northwest from the Appalachians, Fei told the Associated Press. Its population is reduced in the Southeast and more pronounced in the Midwest.Brent Sohngen of Ohio State University, who was not involved in the study, told the AP the findings show "there is no doubt some signature of climate change."The research, which studied 86 species of trees and was based on data gathered by the U.S. Forest Service, was published in the journal Science Advances .
