We can't be 'caught napping' on climate, Johnson tells UN
By Emma Gatten environment editor

THE world cannot be "caught napping" on climate change as it was with the coronavirus, Boris Johnson told the United Nations yesterday, as he outlined plans for a green industrial recovery for the UK driven by technology.

"Humanity was caught napping by coronavirus," the Prime Minister told a UN General Assembly climate roundtable. "We were woefully under prepared. But for climate change, nobody can say that we have not been warned."

He said the UK would "build back better" by pursuing a green industrial strategy that focused on "putting a big bet" on hydrogen to fuel vehicles including buses, trucks and planes, and on wind power. Mr Johnson said the UK would strive to become "the Saudi Arabia of wind" by developing its wind power capacity.

He also said he was now a "complete evangelist" for nascent carbon capture and storage technology, in which emissions are caught and sequestered, and said nuclear and solar power would have an important role to play in the country meeting its climate goals.

A mass rollout of energy efficiency retrofitting of British homes, and bringing forward the current 2040 date to phase out petrol, diesel and hybrid electric vehicles would also be part of the path to decarbonisation, he said.

Critics of hydrogen caution that it is a high-risk investment because to be truly green it is energy intensive and expensive, and otherwise depends on polluting natural gas.
