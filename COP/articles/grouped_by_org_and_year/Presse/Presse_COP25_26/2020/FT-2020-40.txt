Letter: The IPCC's role is neutral and non-prescriptive

In response to Benjamin Zycher's contribution to your debate on climate change and Covid-19 ( Opinion, Head to Head, May 8), the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is to assess published scientific research in a neutral and non-prescriptive way to inform policymakers what we know about the science related to climate change. It is not a campaigning body. The IPCC does not advocate for carbon taxes - or anything else. Its job is to provide policy options.

Governments decided in the Paris Agreement in 2015 to limit global warming to well below 2C while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C, and invited the IPCC to prepare a report on the impacts and related emissions pathways. The IPCC responded to this invitation in 2018 with "Global Warming of 1.5C", an IPCC report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. It was approved and accepted by 195 governments.

The report provides evidence that the risks of climate change are less at 1.5 than at 2C.
