Drax pressured by climate activists for pellet maker tie-up

By Rachel Millard

DRAX shareholders are coming under pressure from environmental activists to oppose the biomass power
plant owner's purchase of a pellet producer.

Last month Drax announced a £226m deal to buy Pinnacle Renewable Energy, which supplies biomass
pellets from Canada and the US to Drax's turbines in North Yorkshire, among other customers. Shareholders
are due to vote on the deal on March 31, but a group of 22 organisations, including ShareAction and Friends
of the Earth US, have written to them warning it creates "ﬁnancial and reputational risks".

Drax has spent years switching four of its six turbines to run on biomass instead of coal, under climate
accounting rules that deem burning biomass to be carbon neutral on the basis that trees sequester carbon
during their lifetime.

Drax said: "Climate change experts and scientists ... have stated sustainable biomass is critical to reach global
climate   targets   -   both   in   generating   renewable   electricity   and   in   delivering   negative   emissions   with
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)."
