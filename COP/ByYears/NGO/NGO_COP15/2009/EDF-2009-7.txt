Rainforests contain half the Earth's species and are vital to many life systems. Today, they also hold the key to a global climate treaty.

President Obama's policies present a dramatic opportunity to create jobs and solve global warming. Now Environmental Defense Fund must get Congress to act.

Less than a year ago, candidate Barack Obama promised an about-face in the nation's environmental policies. The economic stimulus bill passed in February, with its intention to slash America's dependence on fossil fuels, represents the government's biggest commitment to environmental protection in years. But major hurdles still lie ahead.

"This is a stunning departure from the past eight years," says Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp. "Between the stimulus bill and the climate legislation taking shape in Congress, we're opening a new chapter in the fight against global warming." EDF helped shape the final stimulus package, which includes the following:
ท $20 billion investment in energy efficiency for buildings
ท $17.7 billion for mass transit ท Funds for renewable energy research ท Rebates for the purchase of greener
appliances
Now we and our allies must win support from Congress for strong climate action. We've enlisted strategic partners in labor

and manufacturing to help show Congress that a cap on global warming pollution will create vibrant industries and jobs.
ADVISING THE ADMINISTRATION
Shortly after the November election, Krupp put our study Manufacturing Climate Solutions into the hands of Obama energy advisor Carol Browner. Her enthusiastic response paid a big dividend. Vice President Joe Biden named Environmental Defense Fund as expert panelist for the opening meeting of his Task Force on Middle Class Families, charged with making green jobs a pathway to a strong middle class.

WHERE WE STAND By Fred Krupp, President
A new deal for the environment

T. Charles Erickson

ญญญญญ More Americans now work
in the wind industry than in coal mining.
ญญญญญ

Franklin Roosevelt launched the New Deal in 1933 to help lift America out of the Great Depression. Most historians agree, however, that it was World War II that really turned things around.
Today, we are fighting another global war--against climate change. President Obama has launched that war in earnest by calling on Congress to enact a cap on carbon emissions. He has appointed a strong environmental team, including long-time EDF board member Dr. Jane Lubchenco as head of NOAA, the primary climate science agency.
Retooling America's energy infrastructure will not only help save the plan-

et, it also could save the economy. How? By creating jobs for people like Mike Gonzer, a plant manager in Michigan recently laid off from the auto industry but now working assembling wind turbines.
In a recent meeting at the White House, Lawrence Summers, Obama's chief economic advisor, told me that the key to economic recovery is to remake the energy sector. He likened government's role to that of a pair of scissors. One blade would be green spending in the Recovery and Reinvest ment Act; the second blade would be a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. Together, they can help us cut our way out of the recession.

Creating a clean future
Technology is on the brink of producing breakthroughs in the fight against global warming. Entrepreneurs are harvesting energy not just from the sun and wind but from ocean waves, grasses and even algae.
That's the message of the New York Times bestseller Earth: The Sequel by EDF president Fred Krupp and Miriam Horn, now in paperback from W. W. Norton. The new
edition updates progress by featured companies and includes vivid illustrations of how cutting-edge technologies like cellulosic ethanol and wave energy actually work.
"Krupp does what might seem impossible--he delivers a global warming book that leaves you feeling hopeful." ญTime
"If you are worried that the world is heading toward climate catastrophe, here's a book to lift your spirits." ญHarvard Business Review

Dealing with economic turmoil and global warming together makes perfect sense: Behind every clean energy technology--from wind turbines and solar cells to carbon capture and advanced lighting--a parts-and-labor supply chain runs through the heartland of U.S. manufacturing.
For example, Indiana-based SunRise Solar, a maker of solar-powered attic fans, gets plastic and stainless steel brackets from local plants, motors from Pennsylvania, wire from Illinois and thermostats from California. The fast-growing company has helped keep many other U.S. companies afloat in these rough times.
Strong cap-and-trade climate legislation will rapidly create new markets and millions of new jobs in virtually every sector of the economy. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has vowed to have a climate bill on the floor by Memorial Day. Momentum is also building in the Senate. Congress should do all it can to pass a strong bill, and quickly, in order to have maximum leverage for December's UN climate talks in Copenhagen.
As the legislation moves forward, we will stand guard on Capitol Hill to make sure that no last-minute loopholes are inserted in the dead of night. The future of the planet is at stake.

What about wind pollution?
I worked on a maintenance crew servicing 259 wind turbines in northwest Iowa.
While I believe power produced from wind turbines is a good alternative source, there are some problems: moving the energy produced is not efficient because of inadequate transmission systems; there can be pollutants from operation of the turbines; and there needs to be recycling or cleanup after the useful life of the wind turbines. Roger Skelton, Rembrandt, Iowa
Our renewable energy specialist Colin Meehan comments: We currently have enough transmission capacity in most of the windy states to allow a

significant amount of new wind power to be developed. Passing a national cap on global warming pollution will spur even more renewable energy development, as well as the transmission infrastructure it requires.
However, as you point out, wind farms can create local environmental problems, from leaking oil to serious habitat damage. On the positive side, wind farms create much less local environmental damage than coal, natural gas or nuclear power plants. And much of the material is recyclable. In fact, a small cottage industry is already developing around remanufacturing old wind turbines.
To address these issues, EDF helped found the American Wind Wildlife Institute, a consortium of wind developers and environmental organizations. The institute is working to establish rules and incentives for wind developers to site, build, operate and decommission turbines in an environmentally conscious manner.

Elgie Holstein remembers the first time he sat down with PacifiCorp to negotiate removing the utility's dams from the Klamath River in California and Oregon--the focus of years of contentious debate among farmers, environmentalists and Indian tribes.
"PacifiCorp had really been beaten up in the press," recalls Holstein. "They were wary." Instead of ultimatums, Holstein offered them science. "I suggested we cooper- Water diplomat ate on a plan for ex- Elgie Holstein a mining water quality related to the dams," he says. "They jumped on it."
Negotiators reached a tentative agreement last fall to remove the dams in what may be the largest river restoration project in U.S. history. Holstein insists his role was small--he left the process last year to advise the Obama campaign on energy--but injecting facts into an emotional debate helped build trust among the negotiators.
Holstein will bring his skills in negotiating difficult water issues to EDF as the head of our Center for Rivers and Deltas. "Unraveling longstanding conflicts and healing the environment in places like the Colorado River Delta will take creative thinking and an evenhanded approach," says Holstein. "I came to Environmental Defense Fund because it is recognized for both."

PURCHASING POWER
With EDF's help, Wal-Mart takes green business global

Call it a smart business decision. To satisfy the growing demand for green building materials, a California-based startup called CleanBoard now manufactures drywall in a solar-powered factory, using residue from coal-fired power plants as raw material. Even its paper coating is recycled.
"To achieve our goals, we examined every aspect of our supply chain from the sourcing of raw materials to the transportation of finished goods," explains the company's founder, Rod MacGregor.
Imagine if a single retailer could demand such environmental performance from thousands of factories? Environmental Defense Fund set out to help achieve this goal.
The products we buy today are only as green as the energy and materials that go into them--the supply chain. Not long ago, it was common for manufacturers to oversee a product's entire life cycle. Today, that model has been replaced by a vast global supply chain moving products from distant factories to your neighborhood mall.
The environmental costs of this supply chain are immense. For example, U.S. demand for products from China-- $321 billion in 2007--has contributed to China's monumental environmental challenges: fouled air, despoiled rivers and a growing share of the world's global warming emissions.

Wal-Mart wants to green its Chinese supply chain.
A GREENER VISION FOR CHINA
As China's biggest export client, Wal-Mart has taken a special interest in greening China's supply chain and has the clout to make things happen. When the retailer recently invited 1,000 of its Chinese suppliers to an environmental summit in Beijing, suppliers were eager to attend. The company announced ambitious goals:

Pennsylvania steelworker, Pagan was looking for more job stability. With a little training, he easily stepped into a new career assembling the structural backbones of wind turbines. "It's a new industry," he says. "There's opportunity here."
"Our nation is rich with a skilled workforce that is waiting for the economic opportunity that cap-and-trade legislation will bring," says Krupp.
How climate action will affect jobs is the subject of a pitched battle that may determine the fate of climate legislation. Opponents in the oil industry and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are again spending millions to mislead Americans with the falsehood that climate policy is too expensive in a recession. Similar arguments about gas prices stymied a climate bill in 2008.
This time, however, we are in a position to win. "In the fight for climate change legislation, we have advantages we've never had before," said Krupp. "We have solid majorities supporting legislation in both houses of Congress. We have sympathetic committee chairs to guide the action. And we now have a president who understands the nature of the emergency. The stars are aligning at just the right time."

LESS CARBON = MORE JOBS

When Jackie Roberts, EDF director of sustainable technologies, began to research how the U.S. job market will benefit from global warming legislation, she didn't expect to deliver her work directly to the vice president of the United States. But that's exactly what happened on February 27, when Roberts and EDF president Fred Krupp met with Vice President Joe Biden and several cabinet officers, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis.
Roberts' new website, lesscarbonmorejobs.org, profiles 1,200 companies in the renewable energy and energy efficiency fields from Florida to Colorado primed to create new jobs when Congress enacts a cap on global warming pollution. Released at the launch of Biden's task force, the maps show hundreds of communities in coal country, the rust belt and other manufacturing regions poised to benefit.

Valuing forests enough to save them

Frans Lanting

One day in December 2002, Herculano Porto thought the world was coming to an end. Machete in hand, he was clearing brush from the forest floor beneath 150-foot-tall Brazil nut trees in Parแ state in the Brazilian Amazon when he saw four men with guns and chainsaws coming through the forest.

Herculano, who makes a precarious living collecting nuts and fishing, gathered his things and paddled back across the Anfrizio River to his home. Gradually, all around him, the forest began to fall.
For the last two decades, similar scenes have been playing out across the Amazon. Each year, ranchers, farmers and loggers have cleared and burned some four million
137unique species
become extinct every day due to tropical deforestation
acres of rainforest--an area nearly the size of New Jersey--releasing massive quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Business as usual, some models predict, could destroy half the Amazon forest by 2050.
On that December day, Herculano didn't challenge the intruders. But over the next two years he defied death threats and teamed up with Environmental Defense Fund partners to help establish an

"extractive reserve." Inside the reserve, clear-cutting is prohibited but forest dwellers can continue their fishing and nut gathering. In exchange for land rights, education and health care, Herculano and other ribeirinhos, or river folk, agreed to manage the forest sustainably.
"Extractive reserves and indigenous lands, where people on the ground have a direct stake in the forest's survival, offer the best protection for rainforests," says our anthropologist Dr. Stephan Schwartzman, who has spent three decades working in the Amazon. Using satellite data, Schwartzman has documented that reserves stop deforestation.
Extractive reserves, indigenous lands and parks now cover nearly 40% of the Amazon. But that leaves huge swaths of forest unprotected. And in practice it has been difficult to protect sparsely populated areas because of pressure from ranchers, illegal clearing and a lack of economic incentives.
When a group of rice farmers recently challenged the existence of the four million acre Raposa Serra do Sol

Indigenous Reserve near the Venezuelan border, EDF funded our partner, the Instituto Socio-ambiental, to bring in an indigenous lawyer from Raposa to argue before Brazil's Supreme Court, the first indigenous attorney to do so. In a significant victory, the court ruled to support the reserve.
A GLOBAL SOLUTION
Still, the clearing and burning of rainforests continues--in Brazil, Indonesia and elsewhere. Worldwide, driven by the profits to be made from tropical hardwoods, soybeans and beef, between 20 and 40 million acres of rainforest are lost annually.

Remembering CHICO MENDES

Twenty years ago, the legendary union activist Chico Mendes was gunned down by an enraged cattle rancher irked that he'd been denied the right to cut down a tract of Brazilian rainforest.
Mendes' voice may have been silenced, but his legacy lives on. 8 Environmental Defense Fund Solutions

Because Mendes had won international environmental prizes, his murder, unlike the 1,500 or so previous murders for hire in land conflicts in Brazil, became world news.
Illiterate until age 18, Mendes had eked out a living as a rubber tapper, collecting latex from the Amazon's rubber trees. Yet he rose to become Brazil's environmental conscience. He not only organized his fellow tappers into a rural workers' union but also formed them into human barriers whenever cattle ranchers threatened the rainforest that was their livelihood.
In December, on the 20th anniversary of his assassination, EDF anthropologist Dr. Stephan Schwartzman traveled to Brazil to receive the Chico Mendes Prize. The Acre state government recognized 20 people who were important in Mendes' life. "I was deeply honored to be among them," says Schwartzman.
In 1987, Schwartzman had brought Mendes to Washington, DC, to press development banks to curtail loans for Brazil's road-building projects until local people's rights were considered.
Our alliance forced the Brazilian government to change its policies. As part of the Mendes legacy, the extractive reserves he helped create have become a bulwark against deforestation in the Amazon--and a source of hope in solving the world's climate crisis.

Kids who dream in green

THE NEXT WAVE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS IS THE YOUNGEST YET

The popular view that kids raised on TV and the Internet are fated to become passive consumers is contradicted by a new wave of informed environmental activism that reaches all the way down to elementary school.
Jordan Reichgut and Alex Scaperotta were only in third grade when a school screening of Al Gore's documentary about climate change, An Inconvenient Truth, inspired them to become environmental campaigners. The pair, now fifth graders at Cider Mill School in Wilton, CT, launched "Little People, Big Changes," which now has a website and a solid record of accomplishment.
Alex and Jordan regularly team up to talk to student groups and set up informational card tables at supermarkets, libraries and Earth Day celebrations. Largely through their efforts, nearly 200 families in the town of Wilton signed up to pay extra on their utility bills to ensure that renewable energy goes into the regional grid. The signups have earned Wilton a pair of solar panels to be installed at town schools.

The return of flower power: Children are taking pollution into their own hands.

TAKING ACTION LOCALLY
Heeding the slogan,"Think globally. Act locally," the boys created an anti-idling campaign to convince motorists to fight climate change (and local air pollution) by not leaving their cars and trucks running.
According to a new Environmental Defense Fund report, Idling Gets You Nowhere, idling cars and trucks in New York

City alone produce 760 tons of smogforming nitrogen oxides every year. That's the equivalent of 3,000 trucks, each driving a million miles. Pollutants from needlessly running engines are associated with a variety of health risks including cancer, asthma and heart disease--and children are especially vulnerable.
"If you're stopped for more than ten seconds, you save fuel by turning off the engine," Alex said. "So we created a slogan, `If you're stopped for more than ten, turn it off and on again.'" Jordan and Alex created bumper stickers and t-shirts that spread their message all over town. For their efforts they were awarded a Climate Change Leadership Award from Connecticut Governor Jodi Rell.

ADVOCATING GREENER SCHOOL BUSES
Some 1,500 miles away in Austin, TX, another group of fifth graders also zeroed in on unnecessary vehicle idling. Their campaign at Casis Elementary pushed the school to educate parents about the dangers of idling. "It might not have an impact on the world, but it might have an impact on our neighborhood," said fifth-grader Isaac Brown.
Similarly, EDF has been helping youth groups fight for laws to reduce school bus idling. In the Conroe district near Houston, we recruited student volunteers to carry test equipment in their backpacks

as they traveled on the buses. "We found that the air kids were breathing inside the bus was sometimes five to ten times worse than the air outside because of diesel pollution," said our staff scientist Elena Craft.

Alex von Kleydorff

CLEANING UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD
The new wave of children's environmental activism cuts across income levels. In 1998 three 14-year-olds in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood founded the Environmental Enforcers as part of UPROSE, a Latino community organization. The group's work includes air monitoring of diesel trucks on the Gowanus Expressway, which bisects their neighborhood.
Joaquin Brito, a 17-year-old volunteer, started out by collecting air samples. In 2007 he testified before a state commission on improving city air quality. Brito plans to study environmental engineering in college this fall. "Facing our environmental problems is something we have to do for our future," he says.
These young people do seem to think more about the future than earlier generations did. Their hope is to set an example. They're planting seeds, and working to ensure that they take firm root.

Going to work to defend the desert

When the Bureau of Land Management designated a section of California's Mojave Desert as the site of a radioactive waste dump, Hannah Bentley, a prominent environmental lawyer, went to work. She joined forces with Native American tribes and environmental groups and together they won protection for the area as critical habitat for the endangered desert tortoise. From that day on, she was able to camp in the desert she had helped protect. It remains one of her proudest achievements.
Bentley goes to work each day on behalf of the planet: preserving endangered species habitat, protecting vulnerable populations from unjust environmental harm and helping frame policy around California's historic global warming act.
Bentley has bolstered her environmental legacy by designating Environmental Defense Fund as a beneficiary of her IRA and 401(k) retirement plans. Gifts through estate plans provide EDF with resources to meet the most serious environmental challenges of the future.
"As an environmental lawyer, I have long realized the importance of talking with all parties," she says. "I like the way EDF takes the big picture view and makes an effort not to alienate key players. With its ability to build bridges, EDF will be needed more than ever in the years ahead."

Hope for endangered Gulf sea turtles

Sea turtles have been around for at least 110 million years, but today all of them are either endangered or threatened. Off the west coast of Florida, endangered loggerhead turtles have been dying in increasing numbers, accidentally caught up in longline fishing gear. In response, the National Marine Fisheries Service plans to suspend longline fishing. EDF is working hard on a solution to keep fishermen in business while ensuring the steady recovery of turtles and ailing Gulf fisheries.
Currently vessels deploy lines over seven miles long, baited with hundreds of hooks. Our plan is to finance a conversion to fishing gear that does not harm sea turtles.
"We are working closely with both fishermen and regulators," says Heather Paffe, director of EDF's Gulf of Mexico Oceans program. "A small investment will go a long way towards protecting endangered sea life and keeping our coastal businesses viable."
Protective measures secured by EDF off the Texas coast have allowed Kemp's ridley turtles to rebound locally for a record fifth straight year.
Sea turtles and other marine life also will benefit from our campaign to switch troubled fisheries to "catch shares." Under
EDF enlisted fishermen to help save loggerheads. 12 Environmental Defense Fund Solutions

this system, each boat is assigned a percentage of the total allowable catch. Captains can fish sensibly rather than racing to catch fish as quickly as possible. This translates into increased dockside prices while reducing sea turtle entanglements and the inadvertent catching of other fish. Regulators recently approved a catch share for grouper and tilefish in the Gulf.
Paffe is optimistic. "Experience has shown us that environmental solutions are most successful when they make economic sense," she says.

Getting the lead out
Each year, some 400,000 newborns are exposed to dangerous levels of lead.
Lead is a potent neurotoxin, but not until recently were the serious health risks of very low levels of lead established. New studies show that lead levels even lower than EPA's 1978 allowable maximum caused lowered IQ's in children, aggressive behavior in teenagers and car-

diovascular disease in adults. Hence we welcome EPA's deci-
sion to tighten the lead standard tenfold. The new standard, 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter (g/m3), is within the range recommended to EPA by its science advisors. But EPA's own analysis shows that to prevent a measurable decrease in IQ for the most vulnerable children, the lead standard should be set as low as 0.02 g/m3.
EDF has worked to reduce lead exposure since the 1970s, when children's average blood level was seven times higher than today. In 1985, we played a major role in banning lead from gasoline.
"This will help protect children," says John Balbus, M.D., director of our Health program. "But the science justifies an even lower standard."

Air quality in national parks: Persistence pays off
For park visitors, seeing is believing.
The road toward clean air in America's national parks has been a long one. As far back as 1977, Congress set a goal of cleaning up dirty air in major parks and wilderness areas. But this proved more difficult than expected. After years of delays, 37 states still have not produced the plans required to clear the air near national parks.
EDF, Earthjustice and the National Parks Conservation Association successfully sued EPA to compel action. Now the states have two years to get their plans finished and approved.
The stakes are huge. Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from automobiles, power plants and cement manufacturers stunt plant growth, acidify lakes and worsen smog. They also contribute to haze that reduces visibility in Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Great Smoky Mountains to half or less of what it should be.
"With this victory and a newly energized EPA, we're finally on track to restore clean air to America's national parks," said our attorney Kevin Lynch.

CAN WILDLIFE ADAPT TO A WARMING WORLD?

Momtuik-Eastcott/NGS

Scientists are striving to predict how migration will change with global warming and what actions can help wildlife adapt.

You'd be hard-pressed to find two birds more unlike than the golden-cheeked warbler--delicate, private, tiny, and the greater sage-grouse--bulky, ground-dwelling and famously flamboyant in courtship. But for all their differences, the two species face an increasingly common problem: an uncertain future as global warming begins to play havoc with their habitats.

the Ashe-juniper habitat in central Texas. "Part of the coming challenge will be
anticipating the warbler's response to climate change," says Environmental Defense Fund ecologist David Wolfe, who works on habitat in Texas. "We have to protect land not just where they are now but where they will be."

A recent Audubon study revealed that more than 300 species of North American birds already are wintering farther north, some hundreds of miles from their former range. This will create varied and unpredictable

challenges. For the sage grouse, climate change could mean a big squeeze as sagebrush habitat is lost in many areas. The warbler's troubles are even trickier, since the species breeds in only one place in the world,

A RECIPE FOR WILDLIFE
Broadening a species' range greatly increases its resilience in times of stress, so Wolfe is working on buffer zones and corridors that will allow for the bird's next moves. Most of this potential habitat is on private land, and local landowners have embraced Wolfe's efforts.
"Ranchers might have once looked at having an endangered species as a liability, but we look at it as an asset," says one of those landowners, Jay Wagley, a cattle rancher who leases out land to hunters. "Habitat that's good for warblers is habitat that's good for most species."
A thousand miles to the north, this thought is echoed by Margaret Solen Hinson, an Idaho sheep and cattle rancher whose land serves as a gathering spot for courtship rituals of the sage grouse.
"Private lands are the connective tissue for migrating species," she says.
That connective tissue has never been more vital. Habitat preservation, never easy, has become even more difficult with habitat a moving target.
"One of the most complicated issues we face today is how to adapt to climate change," says EDF chief scientist Dr. Ste-

ven Hamburg. "We need to create policies that help species survive and make ecosystems more resilient--not just by capping pollution but by removing other stressors."
The new circumstances require a more active style of habitat management. It will no longer be enough to look back at an area's historic flora and fauna, but to anticipate, through modeling, what will be there next. EDF's Sam Pearsall, who works with estuarine ecosystems in North Carolina's Albemarle Sound, calls this pre-storing habitat, in his case readying freshwater habitats for their brackish future.
"We need to consider that rising seas may transform a terrestrial habitat into a submerged one," he says. "We must actively manage species and habitats or risk losing them."
Another protective approach is to bolster existing populations of endangered species, since a healthy and diverse population is more likely to withstand the effects of climate change.
THE MARMOT'S SALAD BAR
Keeping populations healthy is complicated by the fact that phenology--nature's clock-- is being thrown out of whack. Consider the marmot. For millions of years marmots would crawl out of their dark winter dens to nibble on the green world outside. Their timing was exquisite, their internal clocks prodded by the warmth of spring.

Endangered Species Act: Science wins

The greater sage-grouse celebrates.

President Obama has restored a key Endangered Species Act provision undone by the Bush administration. The decision reestablishes scientific oversight of federal agencies to protect rare species. EDF wildlife chairman Michael Bean, a leader in safeguarding endangered species law, was present at the announcement.
"The president's action is another indication that science is once again respected in the White House," said Bean. "The Endangered Species Act, like many of the plants and animals it protects, is on its way to recovery."

A world apart
IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC, AN OCEAN TREASURE FINDS PROTECTION
Large predatory fish like these sharks rule at Kingman Reef, a place still largely untouched by humans.

In January, President George W. Bush announced the creation of three "marine monuments"--ocean areas off-limits to fishing and mining. All told, the tracts of Central Pacific ocean, dotted with coral reefs and ribbons of spectacular tropical islands, are nearly the size of California. Huge undersea mountains, bubbling hydrothermal vents and the ocean's deepest chasm, the Mariana Trench, remain mostly unexplored beneath the waves.
Environmental Defense Fund, together with the Marine Conservation Biology Institute, worked with the Bush administration to win strong safeguards for the new sanctuaries. We compiled findings from more than 200 leading scientists and built key political backing in support of the plan.
"These new marine monuments rank right up there with our nation's greatest national parks," said EDF executive director David Yarnold.

Sometimes called the Tinkerbell of seabirds, the fairy tern catches fish by swooping down and plucking them from the sea.

The protected areas contain some of Earth's most long-lived shallow-water corals. This giant coral lobe may be 500 years old.
