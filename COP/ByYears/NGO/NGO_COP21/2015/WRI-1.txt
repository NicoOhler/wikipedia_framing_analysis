Who is responsible for taking action, and  what actions should they take? How do we deal with  impacts that often fall on those least responsible for  creating the problem? What are our responsibilities  to future generations?  These questions persist despite more than 20 years  of international cooperation and discussion. With  the impacts of climate change already being felt,  it is clear that that we need answers–and action–  more urgently than ever.  While a new international agreement in 2015 offers  a tremendous opportunity to tackle climate change,  we must also ensure it helps tackle, rather than  heighten, other urgent challenges people face, from  food security and housing to decent livelihoods and  adequate transportation. By focusing not on what  separates us but what unites us–the opportunity for  all humans to achieve wellbeing and lead a dignified  life–climate action and equity can go hand in hand.  Building Climate Equity provides just that new perspective.  It draws on successful experiences tackling  climate change while building peoples’ basic capabilities.  It demonstrates that climate action and equity  can be intricately linked and mutually reinforcing.  Focusing on these links between climate action  and capabilities can result in greater consensus  and more ambitious and effective climate outcomes.  This report provides recommendations to  strengthen the synergies between climate action  and equity both in a new 2015 climate agreement  and beyond. While we cannot set aside critical  issues such as responsibility for emissions, a focus  on capabilities can help us build the necessary consensus  to support a strong, durable, and ambitious  international framework.  We hope this report guides the international  community on the design and implementation of  climate action that builds capabilities and achieves  equity. By doing so, we can look forward to a more inclusive,  low-carbon and climate resilient future  for everyone.  FOREWORD  Andrew Steer  President  World Resources Institute  vi   Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 1  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Climate change poses significant and inter-related equity  challenges. As climate impacts increase so too does the urgency  of addressing these equity challenges. This report offers a new  approach to these challenges by linking actions to combat climate  change with broader equity objectives, placing the wellbeing of  people and communities at the core of climate action. Building on  the findings of 30 case studies in 23 countries it demonstrates how  climate policies within countries, including policies directed at both  low-carbon energy development and resilience to climate change  effects, can simultaneously build the capabilities of individuals and  communities. It provides recommendations for how international  institutions and policymakers can support these national level  actions, and the key role that the new international climate  agreement can play in creating transformational climate action by  focusing on equity and capabilities.   For more than two decades, crafting global actions  that all nations find equitable has been a central  challenge for international climate policy. Contentious  debates over how to equitably combat climate  change and how to equitably assess which countries  are most responsible for taking action has slowed  progress toward a global climate agreement.  As climate impacts mount, so does the urgency of  resolving this challenge. Those least responsible  for climate change are often the most vulnerable  to changes in weather patterns, sea level rise, and  other impacts, further exacerbating existing inequities.  Meanwhile, actions—both to address climate  impacts and to reduce emissions—are intertwined  with broader equity issues involving livelihoods,  health, food security, and energy access.  The urgency of the equity challenge is heightened  by recent negotiations for the new international  climate agreement in 2015. Parties have determined  that the agreement must both be “applicable to all  Parties” while remaining “under the Convention,”  raising questions regarding equity that must be  addressed by global leaders if the agreement is to  build consensus and ambition (UNFCCC 2011).  This report offers a new approach to these challenges  by linking actions to combat climate change  with broader equity objectives, placing the wellbeing  of people and communities at the core of  climate action. It expands the narrative for climate  equity to one that is capable of addressing current  and future climate impacts, human development,  and responsibility for emissions, and that can accelerate—  not impede–momentum for climate action.  It demonstrates that climate action and equity are  integrally linked and can be mutually supportive,  and that the 2015 Agreement, in particular, can play  a key role in strengthening those synergies.  A Capabilities Approach to Climate Action  Building Climate Equity proposes that the international  community adopt a capabilities approach as a  means of embedding equity in climate policy.  First formulated in the development arena by economist  Amartya Sen and philosopher Martha Nussbaum  (Sen 1999; Nussbaum 2003), the capabilities  approach emphasizes the role that access to a range  of basic capabilities plays in human wellbeing and  the realization of human rights. These capabilities  include the opportunity to pursue a decent livelihood;  to benefit from sufficient nutrition, transport,  education, housing, physical safety, and security;  and to engage in collective decision-making.  Climate policies—both those reducing emissions  and those adapting and building resilience to  climate impacts—can contribute to protecting and  strengthening these basic capabilities. Such an  approach not only addresses the challenges posed  by climate change but will build equity and in turn  enable greater consensus for climate action.  Climate Policies at Multiple Levels  Climate action and capabilities are linked at multiple,  interdependent levels as shown in Figure 1. This  includes the capabilities of individuals and communities,  such as those involving livelihoods, health, nutrition,  shelter, physical safety, and decision making.  It also includes national capabilities, such as human  development, economic capacity, resilience to climate  impacts including physical security and capacity  to adapt in the face of climate change, as well as  governance capacity and social support structures.  This report examines how a capabilities approach  can be used to guide equitable climate action at the  international, national, and sub-national levels by  focusing on the promotion and enhancement of  capabilities of the most vulnerable and least well off.  This report offers a  new approach to these  challenges by linking  actions to combat climate  change with broader  equity objectives, placing  the wellbeing of people  and communities at the  core of climate action.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 3     The Report in Brief  This report begins by highlighting how climate policies  within countries, including policies directed at  both low-carbon energy development and resilience  to climate change effects, can simultaneously build  the capabilities of individuals and communities.  These policy examples are drawn from 30 case  studies in 23 countries around the world, including  renewable energy, equitable carbon pricing, fossil  fuel subsidy reform, low carbon transportation,  community forestry, and a range of adaptation and  resilience policies. We focus in particular on the  capabilities of the most vulnerable and least well  off because their capabilities are most at risk and in  need of strengthening.  Building on the findings in these case studies, this  report provides recommendations about ways that  international institutions and policymakers can  concretely support the development and implementation  of these types of actions at the national and  sub-national levels.  Next, the report specifically addresses how the 2015  international climate agreement can take account of  and help build capabilities. This approach enhances  the meaning of “respective capabilities” within the  Convention’s principle of “common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities”  (UNFCCC 1992).  A pragmatic and multidimensional understanding  of national capabilities can assist countries in  evaluating the equitability of actions in the 2015  Agreement. However, this report does not suggest  that capabilities become the sole framework for  pursuing climate equity. Responsibility for climate  change, including historical responsibility, remains  fundamental to the equity discussion and to shaping  global mitigation and adaptation efforts.  To provide a framework for developing and  evaluating countries’ intended nationally determined  contributions (NDCs) in the negotiations,  this report proposes equity criteria based on  national capabilities along with emissions responsibility.  It then suggests how a capabilities approach  can focus attention on the ways in which each  element of the 2015 Agreement can build the  capabilities of countries and communities.  Each of these components is described in more  detail below.    PATHWAYS TO A  LOW-CARBON FUTURE EXAMPLES OF CLIMATE ACTIONS THAT PROTECT OR ENHANCE CAPABILITIES  Renewable energy access  and deployment  Scaling-up the use of renewable energy can improve energy security and access while avoiding  greenhouse gas emissions, and can also offer long-term economic savings and health benefits (Torres-  Duque et al. 2008; Fullerton, Bruce, and Gordon 2008; Palit and Chaurey 2011; Köhlin et al. 2011).  By making finance for renewable energy accessible to marginalized and nontraditional banking  populations (Omwansa and Sullivan 2014) or by designing equitable feed-in tariffs or other  mechanisms (Tongsopit 2014; Chrometzka 2014 ), deployment of renewable energy can enhance  capabilities (Mendonça, Lacey, and Hvelplund 2009).  Equitable carbon pricing Carbon pricing schemes can incentivize emission reductions, support energy efficiency and security  initiatives, and protect or enhance capabilities. Progressive schemes can redirect revenues or other  in-kind benefits to vulnerable populations (British Columbia 2009) (California 2014).  International and national efforts to promote carbon pricing or markets should be based on  assessments of differential vulnerability and include stakeholder participation to ensure that monetary  and nonmonetary benefits flow to vulnerable populations.  Fossil fuel subsidy reform Reduction and eventual elimination of fossil fuel subsidies could contribute to emissions reductions,  support energy efficiency and security, and free up resources for other development priorities, all of  which could benefit long-term capabilities (Mourougane 2010) (IEA 2012).  Subsidies often do not provide a direct benefit to the poorest communities, which are the most  vulnerable to the effects of reform (Arze del Granado, Javier, Coady, and Gillingham 2012). Reform  efforts require careful design and can include transfer mechanisms, broad public communication, and  supports for core development needs (Hassanzadeh 2012).  Low-carbon transportation  planning  Safe and affordable transport options are crucial from a capabilities perspective. Low-carbon transport  systems can help meet mobility needs, as well as reduce emissions and provide health benefits (United  Nations 2013).  Using policy and finance signals to incentivize development of public transit has been successful in  multiple contexts (Road Traffic Technology n.d.).  Community forestry Strengthening community forest management and community forest rights can help reduce emissions  and can also enhance capabilities (Stevens et al. 2014). Efforts to establish legal protections, support  community-led reforestation, and support community management can contribute to both climate and  capabilities goals.   Recommendations for International  Institutions and Policymakers  International institutions and policymakers can  help enable national and local governments to  undertake the types of equitable climate policies  highlighted in Tables 1 and 2. To encourage action,  this report proposes recommendations for a wide  range of international institutions and policymakers,  including multilateral and bilateral development  finance institutions. These recommendations  include the need to:  ▪▪Provide upfront investment for low-carbon pathways  and adaptation efforts that are designed to  enhance equity and build capabilities, including  for equitably designed energy policies.  ▪▪Provide technical assistance, capacity building,  and guidance to enable countries to formulate  and implement the types of equitable climate  policies highlighted here.  ▪▪Ensure that finance is accessible to those who  need it, including nontraditional banking populations,  to undertake innovative and locally  appropriate climate action.  ▪▪Support the implementation of “before and  after” vulnerability assessments and evaluations  to identify impacts of climate action on  the capabilities of affected groups.  ▪▪Enable participatory planning and stakeholder  engagement in the development of climate  policies across all sectors.  Operationalizing Equity and Capabilities  in the 2015 Climate Agreement  The 2015 international climate agreement offers a  critical opportunity to make fundamental progress  on equity issues globally. A capabilities approach to  equity can inform two key dimensions of the agreement.  The first dimension concerns the content of  individual countries’ intended nationally determined  Table 2 | Equitable Climate Policies to Achieve Adaptation and Resilience  BUILDING ADAPTIVE  CAPACITY AND RESILIENCE EXAMPLES OF USING CLIMATE ACTION TO PROTECT OR ENHANCE CAPABILITIES  Addressing adaptation needs  of the most vulnerable  populations  Recognizing that different levels and types of vulnerability exist, both among and within communities,  can help generate equitable adaptation and resilience plans that focus on capabilities.  Integrating assessments of climate hazards with assessments of social vulnerability can result in more  targeted and effective policy interventions (Burton, Huq, Lim, et al. 2002; Huq, Rahman, Konate, et al.  2003; Adger, Neil, Agrawala, et al. 2007).  Inclusive participation Enabling communities and vulnerable populations to determine effective adaptation and resilience  strategies through highly participatory processes can increase their ability to take locally appropriate  and long-term adaptation measures that protect and enhance their social and economic opportunities  (WRI, UNPD, UNEP, et al. 2011; Osbeck. Powell, Gerger Swartling. et al. 2010).  Support for innovation Providing access to credit to early adopters of innovative adaptation and resilience practices,  particularly among highly vulnerable populations, and enabling local and indigenous practices to be  disseminated, are essential to mobilizing effective adaptation (UNFCCC 2013).  National equitable  adaptation planning  Prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable in national adaptation planning, ensuring their  participation in the planning process, and undertaking robust assessments of vulnerability that address  capabilities and social and economic contexts, can all play a vital role in achieving equitable adaptation  and resilience outcomes (UNFCCC 2013).  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 7  contributions (NDCs), while the second dimension  concerns the multiple elements of the 2015 Agreement  as a whole—including mitigation, adaptation,  loss and damage, finance, capacity building, technology,  and transparency and accountability.  Incorporate Equity and Capabilities into Intended  Nationally Determined Contributions  1. Use equity considerations in formulating and  evaluating national contributions  Intended NDCs, which are to become the core  national commitments in the 2015 Agreement,  provide a focal point for embedding equity into the  agreement. The process established for intended  NDCs in the 2015 agreement should ensure that  contributions are equitable as well as sufficient to  achieve the objectives of the Convention. The following  aspects of equity provide a set of criteria by  which to measure the types and levels of contributions  that countries should put forward:  ▪▪Emissions responsibility, including historical,  current, and projected emissions both in per  capita and aggregate terms; and  ▪▪National capabilities, including:  □□ human development;  □□ economic capacity, including consideration  of the relative costs of climate action and the  economic benefits from taking climate action;  □□ resilience to climate impacts, including  physical security and capacity to adapt in  the face of climate change; and  □□ governance capacity and social support  structures.  These criteria offer a perspective concerning respective  capabilities in a range of countries, while maintaining  the clear differences between developed and  developing countries. The criteria provide a means  to evaluate countries’ intended NDCs in terms of  the types and levels of actions proposed.  2. Include specific capabilities-focused policies in  nationally determined contributions  The benefit of using a capabilities approach to help  countries identify specific policies to include in their  intended NDCs is that it encourages an examination  of actual pathways—and potential barriers—to  achieving equitable climate action. Considering  intended NDCs in terms of their national capabilities  provides countries with the opportunity to  identify actions that can be undertaken without  additional resources, as well as further actions that  would be possible with international support.   Incorporate Equity and Capabilities across  Multiple Elements of the 2015 Agreement  1. Focus adaptation and loss and damage on the  most vulnerable populations  A capabilities approach highlights the role that  well-designed adaptation policies can play in  protecting and improving the long-term well-being  and livelihoods of vulnerable populations. The 2015  Agreement should include a collective goal focused  on building the resilience of the most vulnerable  populations. Given the increasing importance of  loss and damage and the need to develop a response  that is robust, consistent, and sustained, the 2015  Agreement should also support the development of  national loss and damage scoping studies to identify  the needs of particularly vulnerable populations.  2. Provide adequate and targeted finance to build  capabilities  Adequate and appropriately directed finance is essential  to building capabilities and enhancing equity. The  2015 Agreement should link post-2020 finance with  developing countries’ national climate strategies and  provide the investment needed for climate policies that  also focus on strengthening long-term capabilities.  3. Create a capacity-building facility  A lack of governance and technical capacity constrains  many governments from undertaking the  planning and analysis needed to take climate action  and enhance capabilities (UNFCCC 2014a). To  prioritize capacity building within the UNFCCC, the  2015 Agreement should create a dedicated capacity-building  facility, which would serve as a focal point to  design, coordinate, support, and manage capability  building across all elements of the 2015 Agreement.  4. Develop and deploy innovative technology that  focuses on capabilities  Technology that is accessible to, and designed for,  the most vulnerable and least well off will be essential  to advancing low-carbon pathways and adapting  in ways that build capabilities. The 2015 Agreement  should stress the importance of financial institutions  in funding research, development, and deployment  of innovative technologies with a particular focus  on technologies that can build the capabilities of the  most vulnerable and least well off.  5. Strengthen transparency and accountability with  a focus on capabilities  Transparency and accountability are essential for a  climate agreement capable of tracking progress and  deepening action over time. A capabilities approach  emphasizes the need to build countries’ capabilities  so they can track and report on emissions, climate  action, and finance. It also focuses on integrating  monitoring of the ways in which climate policy  affects capabilities.  6. Establish an equitable long-term mitigation goal  A collective long-term trajectory for emissions  reductions or specific mitigation actions should be  constructed in a way that helps countries identify  specific policies and investments that help build  capabilities, such as increased access to renewable  energy. In committing to such a goal, the 2015  Agreement must recognize that countries with  different capabilities will progress toward the goal  at different paces and support will be needed to  help countries with lower capabilities achieve the  common goal.  7. Establish cycles of action to strengthen capabilities  The set of “cycles” envisioned in the 2015 Agreement  for strengthening action after 2015 should  incorporate a focus on building capabilities  (UNFCCC 2014b). Each cycle should include an  analysis of how future actions can be designed to  further strengthen capabilities. The formulation  and assessment of countries’ commitments should  be informed by a set of equity criteria, including  those involving capabilities, determined through a  technical process in the UNFCCC after 2015.  Capabilities and Long-Term Transformation  The long-term goal of climate policy should be to  protect and strengthen the capabilities and fundamental  well-being of current and future generations.  In doing so, we must look at familiar principles  with new eyes. The discussion should not be in the  abstract but rather focused on action to preserve and  strengthen specific outcomes for people and communities.  As policymakers and communities encounter  new challenges, a capabilities approach to climate  policy analysis and implementation can help keep  the long-term enhancement of human well-being  firmly at the center of attention and build the political  momentum needed for transformation.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up INTRODUCTION  Equity is at the heart of three core issues for climate change policy:  addressing the impacts of climate change, which are felt unequally;  determining who is responsible for taking actions to limit its effects;  and understanding the ways in which climate policy intersects  with other dimensions of human development, both globally and  domestically. This report uses the capabilities approach to address  these challenges, creating a new narrative for equitable climate action  that focuses on building the capabilities of those on the ground as  well as building consensus in the international climate negotiations.   Equity in the climate change policy context is a  central, but still deeply debated, concept. In its  simplest form, equity involves concepts of fairness  or justice in the way people are treated, though it  ultimately depends on the perspectives of those  involved in striving to achieve it. The central equity  challenges for climate change policy involve several  core issues: addressing the impacts of climate  change, which are felt unequally; identifying who  is responsible for causing climate change and for  actions to limit its effects; and understanding the  ways in which climate policy intersects with other  dimensions of human development, both globally  and domestically.  In 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention  on Climate Change (UNFCCC or the Convention)  laid out the centrality of equity in its core principles.  Article 3(1) states that, “The Parties should  protect the climate system for the benefit of present  and future generations of humankind, on the basis  of equity and in accordance with their common  but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities” (UNFCCC 1992).  Ever since, debates about precisely what equity  means in a climate policy context, and how to put  it into practice, have been at the center of international  climate negotiations and policymaking. Many  of these debates have focused on questions about  who should take action to combat climate change,  what actions they should take, and who should  finance them. Resolving these differences is critical  to achieving a workable international climate agreement  in 2015. It also requires us to look at equity  in new ways, to bring countries together around an  ambitious but equitable climate action agenda.  These questions found their original expression in  the Convention through differentiation of Parties  central obligations. Countries categorized under  Annex I, primarily but not solely developed countries,  are obligated to take measures to mitigate  climate change. Annex 1 Parties later agreed to  more detailed obligations and commitments for  emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol  (UNFCCC 1998 Article 3).  Differentiation between developed and developing  country Parties has also informed obligations for  finance and technology transfer under the Convention.  Developed countries in Annex II, a subset of  those included in Annex I, committed to provide  funding and other resources to help developing  countries both reduce their emissions and adapt to  climate change (Winkler and Rajamani 2013).  Over time, however, the binary distinction between  developed and developing countries has softened  as global economies and emission trajectories have  changed leading to calls from many Parties, both  developed and developing, that a new model of differentiation  may be required (Rajamani 2012, 616).  In 2011, the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17)  in Durban agreed to launch a new platform of negotiations  for a new international climate agreement  to be finalized in 2015 and become operational in  2020 (called the 2015 Agreement) (UNFCCC 2011).  The negotiating platform, called the Durban Platform,  contained no explicit reference to equity, but  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up the Parties agreed that the 2015 Agreement would  be “a protocol, another legal instrument or an  agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention  applicable to all Parties.”  The term “applicable to all” was intensely debated  at Durban because it was seen by many Parties  as signaling a political intention to create greater  symmetry in the commitments undertaken by  all Parties to the 2015 Agreement (Winkler and  Rajamani 2013, 2). How to satisfy this requirement,  while remaining under the Convention, namely the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) as laid  out in Article 3(1), has once again brought questions  about the meaning of equity to the forefront  in international climate negotiations. If the 2015  Agreement is to establish a more complex model  of differentiation, how might it be designed to take  into account the varying human development needs  and inequities in human well-being among Parties  to the Convention? What is an equitable allocation  of responsibility and action in the context of growing  emissions and climate impacts?  In addition, the process for negotiating a new  climate agreement at COP 21 in 2015 has itself  triggered questions about fair treatment. Countries  will present the mitigation measures they propose  to undertake in the form of “intended nationally  determined contributions” (intended NDCs). These  will be assessed or reviewed and countries might  be expected to adjust their proposed contributions.  Because governments submit their own initial  proposals, there is an urgent need to determine  the equity considerations that should guide those  contributions. An expanded view of how to assess  equitable action is necessary to encapsulate the  multidimensional nature of equity.  Ensuring equity in the 2015 Agreement is not limited  to mitigation measures, a point that has been highlighted  by climate policy analysts Harald Winkler and  Lavanya Rajamani (2013, 4), stating that “Applying  equity only to mitigation is unlikely to be fair to all.”  As a result, in equity debates globally. As nations face  the early consequences of, and rising threats from,  climate impacts, the objectives and institutions of  the global climate regime, including the UNFCCC,  have expanded beyond the imperative of emissions  reduction – so too has the analysis of equity. Increasing  focus must accordingly be placed on the issues  that support climate adaptation and resilience as well  as mitigation—including finance and investment,  transparency and accountability, and technology, and  capacity building (Klinsky and Winkler 2014).  Understanding Equity in the  Context of Climate Change  Three key dimensions of equity cut across the  climate debate. These are responsibility for greenhouse  gas emissions, the disproportionate nature  of vulnerability to climate impacts and the need  to support the continued ability for countries to  develop in the face of climate change. Each of these  considerations is discussed below, highlighting the  complex and multidimensional nature of equity in  the context of climate change.   Equity Considerations in Reducing Emissions  In the climate context, international discussions of  equity have traditionally focused on interpretations  of the principle of CBDR-RC and, more specifically,  on how to apportion the mitigation actions needed  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The responsibility  to take action has been seen as a function  of a country’s emissions: how much it has emitted,  is emitting, or will emit, have been the key factors  considered in proposing requirements for action.  However, linking greenhouse gas emissions and  mitigation actions in a concrete way has been a  matter of substantial debate.  Consider Historic Emissions  According to one view, expressed by many developing  countries, particularly emerging economies,  developed countries should take the lead in the  mitigation effort because they are historically  responsible for the majority of global greenhouse  gas emissions (see, for example, Algeria 2014;  China 2014; Cuba 2014; Like-Minded Developing  Countries 2014a; Like-Minded Developing  Countries 2014b;). Their case is bolstered by the  Convention, which states that developed countries  should “take the lead in combatting climate change”  (UNFCCC 1992).  Proponents of this viewpoint often argue that an  allocation of emissions should be assigned to countries  on a per capita basis. For instance, the BASIC  Expert Group, a group of climate policy experts  from the governments and leading academic  institutions of the BASIC countries (Brazil, South  Africa, India, and China), explored the implications  of using different cumulative emission metrics as a  framework for assigning mitigation burdens among  parties (BASIC Experts Group 2011). Among their  proposals was a methodology that involves calculating  total GHG emissions since the beginning of  the industrial revolution in 1850 on an equal per  capita basis (BASIC Experts Group 2011, 61). Using  this approach, the quantity of future emissions still  possible if the world is to keep temperature below a  specific level—the available “carbon budget”—would  be assigned to countries according to how much of  the per capita budget they have already used.  Proponents of this approach assert that, because  developed nations have exceeded their fair share of  the carbon budget, they must take the greatest share  of emissions reductions and provide the means (support  for finance, technology, capacity building) for  developing countries to mitigate and adapt.  Others, including major developed nations and  some developing countries, have argued that the  convention’s principles are dynamic and should  respond to changing environmental, geopolitical,  and economic realities (see, for example, Mexico  2014; Switzerland 2014; United States 2014;  Australia 2014; Norway 2014). Proponents argue  that all major emitters should be held to obligations  to take climate action and the UNFCCC’s annexes  must be made more flexible or relaxed.  Focus on Current Emissions  These countries argue that responsibility to act  should focus on greenhouse gases released in the  present and future to keep temperature rise below  catastrophic levels. According to this approach,  emissions are considered in the aggregate rather  than on a per capita basis, since a ton of carbon  has the same effect no matter where it is emitted.  The pattern of greenhouse gas emissions among  countries has shifted significantly in the past 15  years and will shift even further in the near future.  In 1990, developing countries (those not listed in  Annex I of the Convention) contributed 40 percent  of annual global emissions. By 2010, their share  of global emissions was nearly 60 percent; in that  time, China’s share of global emissions increased by  12 percent, representing the majority of developing  countries’ increased share (CAIT 2.0).  Proponents of this view include not only developed  countries but also countries that contribute little to  emissions but lack the financial and other resources  to adapt to climate change, such as small island  states and least developed countries. In addition,  a growing number of middle-income countries,  particularly in Latin America, have asserted that the  collective objective of avoiding catastrophic impacts  is a pressing reason for them to act by reducing  emissions (AILAC 2014).  However, the average per capita emissions of  developing countries, and particularly of the least  developed countries (LDCs), generally remain  smaller than those of developed countries. Given  that efforts to pursue development can at times  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up conflict with the need to reduce emissions, an  essential question for the long term is how developing  countries can pursue low-carbon pathways in  ways that promote economic development.  Consider Capability to Mitigate  The question of which countries should take what  mitigation actions has also been explored on the  basis of countries’ capabilities, drawing on the  “respective capabilities” language of CBDR-RC in  Article 3(1) of the Convention as a starting point.  Proponents have generally defined capability as the  ability of a country to pay for mitigation action, with  some suggesting gross domestic product (GDP) per  capita as the metric for determining capacity to pay  for emissions reductions.  Some policy experts have proposed that the weight  given to emissions in determining responsibility  could depend on whether they are “survival,”  “development,” or “luxury” emissions, and have  suggested reducing emissions responsibility to  allow for costs that are necessary for poverty reduction  (Fleurbaey et al. 2014, sec. 4.6.2.1; Müller  and Mahadeva 2013, 2). Using this approach, the  concept of capability includes the “right to development,”  implying that least-able countries would  have lower emissions reduction requirements,  based on measures such as the Human Development  Index (BASIC Experts Group 2011).  Use an Equity Reference Framework  More recently, the Africa Group and others have  proposed the use of an “Equity Reference Framework”  (ERF) to inform emissions reduction allocations  (Africa Group 2014). This would include a  basket of factors, such as emissions responsibility,  GDP per capita, and development metrics, allowing  a more flexible approach that reflects the multiple  dimensions of equity in a climate context.  Cost Effectiveness  An additional approach to respective capabilities,  is to consider the cost-effectiveness of countries’  actions to reduce emissions, which suggests that  reductions should be apportioned to equalize marginal  costs across countries (Höhne, den Elzen, and  Escalante 2013, 5; Höhne, et al. 2014, 2).  Equity Considerations in Climate Impacts  In addition to responsibility for emissions, the  impacts of climate change on human society also  raises profound equity concerns that must be  addressed through climate action. The Fifth Assessment  Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC) warned that climate change  is happening now and that, within the 21st Century,  “climate-change impacts are projected to slow down  economic growth, make poverty reduction more  difficult, further erode food security, and prolong  existing and create new poverty traps, the latter  particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots  of hunger.” (Romani, Rydge, and Stern 2012).  These climate impacts will be felt globally, but they  will not be experienced equally. The impacts of  climate change pose, and will continue to pose, the  greatest threats to those most vulnerable—typically  those who have the fewest resources to meet them,  or are the most socially and politically marginalized  (Box 1). This is true today and will be for many  decades to come, with future generations—who  have no representation and have not contributed  to the problem—likely to be most affected. For   example, shifting monsoon seasons are likely to  disrupt agricultural patterns across South Asia,  wreaking havoc with communities’ abilities to grow  sufficient food and continue to inhabit rural agricultural  areas. Salt-water intrusion, sea level rise,  and coastal erosion could threaten physical safety,  economic vitality and the ability to pursue livelihoods  in coastal communities around the world.  Even a 1.5o C global temperature increase will result  in serious harm to sensitive areas and vulnerable  populations (IPCC 2014).  Meeting Development Needs  Addressing issues of human development are  critical to consensus-based international climate  action. The causes and consequences of climate  change are deeply intertwined with global patterns  of inequality. Climate change acts as a multiplier of  existing vulnerabilities and threatens to roll back  gains in poverty reduction and progress toward the  Millennium Development Goals that already have  been achieved as well as undermining future efforts  toward the Sustainable Development Goals (World  Bank 2010).  There is no argument among countries that economic  development must continue in order to  address the substantial global inequities in wellbeing.  Although global poverty has been halved in  recent decades, wide disparities remain in health,  education, energy, housing, transport, and access  to water and other resources (World Bank 2014b).  Recognition of ongoing human development needs  in the climate context has always been enshrined in  Article 2 of the Convention, which recognizes that  GHG stabilization, “should be achieved within a  time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt  naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production  is not threatened and to enable economic  development to proceed in a sustainable manner”  (UNFCCC 1992). Thus, efforts to reduce development  inequities among countries must inform any  climate policy approach, if it is to be considered  equitable. Moreover, progress in human development  is threatened by increasing climate impacts,  whose severity varies in part according to the vulnerability  and capacity of those facing them. Building  the underlying capabilities of communities is  therefore a central strategy for minimizing climate  losses and safeguarding human development.  Recent evidence shows substantial opportunities for  social and economic gains from climate action, in  addition to savings related to avoiding catastrophic  impacts (The Global Commission on the Economy  and Climate 2014). Moreover, as this report argues,  climate action is mutually supportive of efforts to  build capabilities and enhance equity.  A New Narrative  Global progress has been held back largely by  disagreement over what level of action is appropriate  for whom and when such action must be taken.  Disagreement has been most contentious when  considering competing needs for development and  climate action—often creating a false competition,  resulting in a zero-sum outcome. Since climate  action is in the long-term interest of all, establishment  of the conditions supporting consensus is also  in the interest of all. What is needed is an understanding  of how action will strengthen consensus  over time so that increasingly stronger action can  be taken to confront climate change and achieve  development simultaneously.  References to vulnerability, and those most vulnerable,  capture those systems, sectors, regions, and individuals  most likely to be especially impacted by climate change.  The types of climate change impacts that will occur, such  as shifts in seasonal rainfall, droughts, cyclones, and  rising sea levels, will vary from location to location.  The severity of impacts in any location will be  determined, in part, by the vulnerability of the local  people and ecosystems on which they rely. These  differences in vulnerability—both within and among  countries—stem from a wide range of social, economic,  political, geographical, and ecological factors. In  all sectors and regions, certain groups of people  will be particularly vulnerable because of structural  and situational drivers of vulnerability that may be  unconnected to geographical location. These typically  include the poor, young children, women, the elderly and  populations such as indigenous people who have been  historically marginalized and underrepresented.  BOX 1 | WHO IS MOST VULNERABLE TO  CLIMATE CHANGE?  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up If this is to happen, this report argues, we must  consider familiar principles in new contexts. In  considering the principles of equity and CBDR-RC,  an enhanced notion of “respective capabilities”  should inform our deliberations. When responsibility  to take action is discussed, the discussion should  be focused on responsibility for action to achieve  particular outcomes. We suggest that one important  outcome is to preserve and strengthen the capabilities  of people, especially the poor and most vulnerable,  to confront climate change. Over time, this  will build the capacity of nations and strengthen  their ability to take climate action, and can even  strengthen the consensus for action.  Fortunately, we have reached a point where countries  do not have to choose between making progress  on poverty and growth and confronting climate  change. In the following chapters, we elaborate on  the meaning and significance of viewing climate  action through the lens of a capabilities approach.  We show how capabilities can be strengthened by  climate action at the country level in a way that  promotes equity and addresses poverty.  This report does not argue that a capabilities  approach should become the only framework  for pursuing climate equity. Rather, we propose  that the concept of capabilities offers useful guidance  in achieving equitable climate action that  is grounded in a thorough understanding of the  geographical, social, and economic differentiation  that exists among individuals and communities.  This understanding can be used to build consensus  and collective ambition in the international climate  agreement in 2015, as well as to support the design  and implementation of policies at all scales that  strengthen capabilities.    RIGHTS, CAPABILITIES  AND BUILDING EQUITY  Given the state of equity discussions in the climate negotiations, and  the opportunities and challenges provided by the 2015 Agreement,  this chapter introduces the concept of the capabilities approach  and discusses how it applies to climate action. We describe how  the capabilities of individuals, communities and nations can  be built through well designed climate action. By proposing a  capabilities approach for climate action, we also explain how a  focus on capabilities in climate policy can be used to augment an  understanding of national capabilities and common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).   Given the state of equity discussions in the climate  negotiations, and the opportunities and challenges  provided by the 2015 Agreement, this chapter  introduces the concept of the capabilities approach  and discusses how it applies to climate action. We  describe how the capabilities of individuals, communities  and nations can be built through well-designed  climate action. By proposing a capabilities  approach for climate action, we also explain how  a focus on capabilities in climate policy can also  be used to augment an understanding of national  capabilities and common but differentiated responsibilities  and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).  The Relationship of Capabilities to  Human Rights and Development  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states  that “All human beings are born free and equal in  dignity and rights” (United Nations 1948, Article 1).  The declaration then articulates a suite of fundamental  rights common to all people, which they  should be able to exercise. These include:  ▪▪Rights to life and liberty and security of person  ▪▪Social, political, and cultural rights that guarantee  one’s right to engage in social and political  life and participate in decision-making  ▪▪Rights designed to ensure adequate material  resources to allow free and dignified choices.  Since its adoption in 1948, the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights has become a powerful document  asserting the essential importance of each individual’s  claim to the core rights needed to live a dignified  life. These rights have been adopted by the vast  majority of the world’s countries, but many people  are still denied some or all of their human rights. For  example, Article 23 recognizes that “everyone has the  right to work, to free choice of employment, to just  and favorable conditions of work and to protection  against unemployment.” Yet, faced with dire poverty  and limited opportunities to access education, mobility,  or essential resources, millions of people do not  have free choice of employment or access to safe or  adequate working conditions.  It was recognition of precisely this gap between the  fundamental rights all people can claim in theory,  and their ability to access and exercise these rights  in practice that spurred a focus on capabilities.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Focus on Capabilities  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, development  specialists Amartya Sen (Sen 1999) and Martha  Nussbaum (Nussbaum 2003) proposed that  scholars and public policymakers focus on efforts  to ensure capabilities. In this context, capabilities  are what provide people the ability to achieve their  human rights. For example, a capabilities approach  asks whether people are able to become educated,  and then examines what resources are needed to  ensure that all people can access and exercise their  right to education. This approach to public policy  has been deployed in a wide range of contexts (see  Robeyns 2006 for a review). For instance, it has  been used to examine the ways in which gender  (Robeyns 2003) and disability (Burchardt 2004;  Nussbaum 2009) have shaped the achievements  and choices of women and people with disabilities.  In these cases, it has led to better identification  of specific policies and changes needed to help  empower people to achieve their capabilities.  A capabilities approach has been instrumental in  informing thinking in the development arena (Box  2, leading, for example, to the formulation of the  Human Development Index produced by the United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In the  climate context, its central tenet—that capabilities  are needed to ensure realization of human  rights—can be used to propose proactive capability-building  strategies as part of climate policy.  Amartya Sen characterized a capabilities approach as  a way to recognize that human flourishing depends on  multiple factors, such as adequate shelter, sufficient  nutrition, and social engagement, that cannot be easily  aggregated into a single metric.  Recognition that human development could not be  captured by a single metric informed the design of the  United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP)  Human Development Index, which covers several key  capabilities—namely health, education, and economic  resources. However, the index was seen as only one  possible manifestation of a capabilities approach.  Since then, the UNDP’s annual Human Development  Reports have expanded on multiple aspects of  capabilities—including gender, human rights, and  democratic political institutions (see Fukuda-Parr 2003  for a review).  The central rationale for using a capabilities approach  has been to identify what supports or hinders people as  they try to live full lives. In Sen’s words, “development is  freedom.” This capabilities perspective can draw attention  to pathways that enhance people’s well-being and can be  used to identify strategies that support climate actions  and contribute to multiple aspects of human well-being.  BOX 2 | USING A CAPABILITIES  APPROACH IN PUBLIC POLICY   Human Well-Being  The capabilities approach focuses directly on  human well-being, which is conceptualized as the  ability of each person to have the freedom and  dignity to make meaningful choices about how he  or she wishes to live. This approach recognizes that  each human requires multiple core needs and rights  to be satisfied in order to achieve well-being. For  example, sufficient income without physical safety  does not result in well-being, nor would access to  education without sufficient nutrition. Capabilities  consist of people’s ability to access and use  resources to achieve their own ideas about what a  dignified life looks like.  The conceptualization of human well-being in the  capabilities approach is important in two ways.  First, the capabilities approach recognizes multiple,  no-nsubstitutable capabilities because of the  multidimensionality of human well-being. Second,  by centering on human well-being, the capabilities  sees resources as necessary means to an end but  not the core focus of attention. Instead, a capabilities  approach emphasizes the need to understand  which resources or opportunities are limiting the  achievement of well-being in particular situations  and to focus on identifying pathways for building  capabilities. Using this approach can move debates  away from zero-sum stalemates about resources in  the abstract, and refocus attention to the creative  process of supporting people’s ongoing efforts to  achieve well-being.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides  a framework for identifying capabilities essential to  realizing human rights. An ongoing debate has examined  the need for, or utility of, a universal list of capabilities. In  this report we do not insist on a universal list but suggest  that many important capabilities can be identified by  basing our conception of human well-being on the  call for human rights. An illustrative list of capabilities  stemming from the Declaration, and likely to be impacted  in a changing climate, includes the following:  ▪▪Sufficient nutrition as guaranteed by the right to life  (Article 3)  ▪▪Physical safety, health, and bodily integrity (Article 3,  Article 25)  ▪▪Adequate shelter and physical comfort (Article 25)  ▪▪Sufficient and safe employment (Article 23)  ▪▪Active inclusion and engagement in a meaningful  social network or community (Article 27)  ▪▪Access to education (Article 26)  ▪▪The opportunity to be engaged in decision-making at  the individual or collective level (Article 21)  BOX 3 | CAPABILITIES AND  THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION  OF HUMAN RIGHTS  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up In proposing the capabilities approach as a new lens  through which to achieve equity in climate actions,  there must be an awareness of its limitations. A key  criticism has been that while the approach provides  a framework for analyzing the relationships between  specific policies and human well-being, it does not  provide a full-fledged theory of justice (Robeyns  2005). It does not tell us who should be responsible  for providing the resources necessary to achieving  capabilities, although it does help us identify who  has which capabilities, and why differences among  people or groups of people may be occurring. In  addition, there is a wide range of capabilities; fully  assessing all of them would be data intensive and  perhaps impossible (Clark 2006).  In this report, we do not seek to evaluate a complete  set of capabilities for an individual or group of individuals;  rather, we use the approach to identify links  between climate policies and capabilities in the interest  of proactively designing policies that can enhance  equity (Box 3). Sen’s capabilities approach asks us  to focus on understanding what, exactly, is either  helping or preventing people from being able to live  in dignity; each person should have the resources  and opportunities to be able to make meaningful  decisions about how he or she wishes to live his or  her life. We therefore focus our discussion of equity  on the most vulnerable and the least well off because  they either do not have sufficient capabilities or are  on the edge of having these capabilities eroded to a  point at which they would again face deeply limiting  options about their lives (Box 4).  The capabilities that we address are a starting point  to illustrate how the capabilities approach can  support the achievement of broader human rights  in line with the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights and support an understanding of national  capabilities to augment the principle of CBDR-RC  in the international context.  The capabilities approach is not a complete theory of  justice because it does not indicate specifically what an  equitable allocation of resources or burdens is, nor does  it identify who is responsible for particular obligations.  Instead, the capability approach acknowledges the equal  value of all people, and imposes a strong guideline  that each person must have sufficient resources and  opportunities to live in dignity, however he or she defines  this. The opportunities people have to make genuinely  free decisions are their “capabilities.” This criterion  draws attention to the situation of those who either do  not have sufficient capabilities, or who are on the edge of  having these capabilities eroded to a point at which they  would lose the ability to make free and dignified choices  about their lives. For this reason the report focuses  particularly on the capabilities of those who are least well  off or most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.  BOX 4 | WHY THE CAPABILITY APPROACH  FOCUSES ON THE MOST VULNERABLE  AND LEAST WELL OFF   Characteristics of a Capabilities Approach  Viewing equity through the lens of a capabilities  approach places people and communities at the  heart of climate policy and moves beyond abstract  arguments about burden sharing. The key driver for  such an approach is recognition that climate change  will have particularly negative impacts on those  who are most vulnerable, regardless of where they  live. Without addressing this fundamental inequity  and supporting approaches that build capabilities  as well as the systems that provide for them, the  international response to climate change will fall  short of its equitability mandate.  Three core characteristics of the capabilities  approach enable the approach to guide policy  towards a focus on people and communities and  towards equitable climate action. These are that  human well-being is (1) multidimensional, (2) it  is the end goal, and (3) individual capabilities are  embedded in larger systems. Each characteristic is  described below.  Human Well-Being is Multidimensional  As described earlier, a basic tenet of a capabilities  approach is the recognition that each human being  has multiple human rights, and these are not substitutable.  Since capabilities are what people need to  realize and use their rights, capabilities too are multiple  and non-substitutable, although interdependent.  For example, the ability to access and benefit  from education requires several other capabilities,  including the ability to enjoy bodily health and  experience physical and psychological safety. If a  child does not have sufficient nutrition, physical  safety, and social support, she is unlikely to benefit  fully from the presence of a village school to access  her right to education, but this does not mean that  these capabilities are interchangeable. Rather, they  are interdependent, and non-substitutable.  The multidimensional nature of well-being means  that single metrics cannot and should not be used to  determine equity in the context of climate-change  policies. If the ultimate goal of climate policy efforts  is to promote and ensure human flourishing, then a  multidimensional approach that acknowledges many  different human needs and capabilities is required.  Human Well-Being is the End Goal  A capabilities approach places the achievement of  human well-being as the ultimate end goal. This is  also reflected in the UNFCCC’s objective of human  development: “The ultimate objective of this Convention  … is to achieve… stabilization of greenhouse  gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that  would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference  with the climate system. Such a level should be  achieved within a timeframe sufficient…to enable  economic development to proceed in a sustainable  manner.” (UNFCCC 1992, Article 2)  We argue that climate change policy should also be  oriented toward furthering human well-being both  through avoiding climate impacts, and through  using climate action to support and enhance  capabilities. The capabilities approach forces decision-makers  to consider the resources that might  be needed in specific situations, and encourages  long-term innovative thinking about policy options  for achieving well-being.  Individual Capabilities are Embedded  in Larger Systems  Finally, people do not live in isolation but are  embedded in social, political, and economic systems.  The capability to achieve human well-being depends  on a range of resources, many of which need to be  supplied by the state or society in general. Capabilities  are experienced individually; however, social,  economic, and material structures, many of which  operate at the national level, provide the foundations  for developing individual capabilities.  While national and individual capabilities are  different, they are related. By acknowledging the  extent to which human capabilities and well-being  in general are dependent on, and affected by, larger  national systems and structures, we can begin to  think further about countries’ capabilities that  should be included in international debates about  equity and climate action.  The capabilities of countries, in terms of their abilities  to provide structures and resources to enable  human well-being, is an important element of the  international equity conversation around action  on climate change, discussed later in this chapter.  Because inadequate access to resources can prevent  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up people from developing capabilities, attention to  both specific resource needs and their distribution  is important for directing policy efforts toward  increasing the capabilities of the most vulnerable or  least well off.  Two Pillars for a Capabilities Approach  to Climate Change Equity  Drawing on an understanding of the capabilities  approach as expressed above, this report proposes  that the international community adopt the  approach as a means of embedding equity in climate  policy. The capabilities approach, as it applies  to climate equity, rests on two interrelated pillars:  Pillar 1. Sufficient mitigation and adaptation actions  are required to prevent the direct impacts of climate  change from eroding the capabilities of the least well  off and most vulnerable, now and in the future.  This pillar concerns the direct impacts of climate  change on people’s capabilities, particularly those  of the most vulnerable. This includes impacts that  result from inadequate mitigation, insufficient  adaptation, or a failure to address loss and damage  caused by climate change. Impacts on both current  and future generations should be considered.  Pillar 2. Climate policies should be designed to  enhance, rather than diminish, the capabilities of  those who are most vulnerable, least well off, and  least able to represent themselves.  This pillar addresses the effects that climate policies  themselves can have on human capabilities. Climate  policies to reduce emissions or build resilience to  climate impacts can either enhance the capabilities  of the most vulnerable and least well off, or exacerbate  existing inequities and undermine efforts in  other policy arenas.  Taken together, these two pillars provide a basis for  understanding how to apply a capabilities approach  to equity in climate action. Such a basis encourages  climate policies to seek to build long-term capabilities,  while also contributing to society’s ability to  move toward a low-carbon and climate-resilient  model of development. By recognizing that climate  action and equity are linked and can be mutually  supportive, this base requires focusing attention  and resources on ensuring that climate action  contributes to efforts to promote the well-being of  all vulnerable people—regardless of location—and  to preferentially provide benefits to those who are  least well off, or least represented.  A capabilities approach to achieving climate equity  demands strong mitigation action to avoid future  climate impacts, addressing equity concerns  Intergenerational equity is the principle that humans  “hold the natural and cultural environment of the Earth  in common both with other members of the current  generation and with other generations, past and future  (Weiss 1990). It is a core component of equity.  The UNFCCC recognizes that climate change is  fundamentally an intergenerational problem. ”The Parties  should protect the climate system for the benefit of  present and future generations of humankind, on the  basis of equity and in accordance with their common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities”  (UNFCCC 1992, Article 3[1]).  Strong mitigation action to prevent a 2oC warming, and  the devastating impacts it would trigger, is essential to  protecting the core capabilities of future generations. In  addition, purposefully considering future generations  in the design of climate action could build their  capabilities and well-being. For example, efforts to  invest in new employment strategies that expand the  reach of renewable energy to marginalized communities  could provide long-term livelihood options. Similarly,  investments in low-carbon, climate-resilient building  or climate-resilient agriculture research and practice  support the ability of communities and countries to build  the foundations for future well-being.  Thinking about intergenerational equity from a  capabilities perspective may help to identify investments  that could reduce future generations’ vulnerability to  such situations. For example, Bangladesh is building  long-term capabilities in the face of serious coastal  threats by increasing educational opportunities. Shifting  the employment patterns of youth and future generations  away from agriculture in climate-sensitive areas and  toward new opportunities could build long-term  resilience, but it requires investments in education now.  BOX 5 | INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY  AND CAPABILITIES   under the first pillar. However, since many climate  impacts are already occurring, it also urges actions  that include efforts to address those impacts in  ways that will build the long-term capabilities of  impacted communities. It emphasizes that climate  action should not come at the expense of human  well-being (second pillar).  Finally, and of critical importance, a capabilities  approach is applicable to both current and future  generations, and therefore accords with the principle  of intergenerational equity (Box 5). Climate  change presents significant threats to future wellbeing.  Not only are future generations likely to be  most vulnerable to its impact, they are also least  represented in current decisions on climate action.  Without transformation toward low-carbon and  climate-resilient development, future generations  who played no part in generating historic emissions  will have increased difficulty in achieving wellbeing.  A capabilities approach can therefore serve  as a useful tool to guide policymakers toward efforts  that support the development of long-term and  lasting human capabilities and the ultimate goal of  transformative climate action.  Capabilities and the International  Equity Challenge  National Capabilities and Climate Change  Many of the core systems crucial to the development  of capabilities—including education, health  care, social security, legal recourse for public  engagement and property rights, and the judiciary—  are explicitly dependent on functioning  governments. Other resources needed for certain  capabilities, such as income, are tightly linked to  the vitality of national economic systems. At some  level, all capabilities depend on physical security  and environmental integrity.  As highlighted in the Introduction, the capabilities  approach was designed to facilitate comparison  and to highlight inequalities in actual or potential  capabilities. This element of the approach can be  used to operationalize concepts of equity in international  negotiations under the UNFCCC. Individual  rights and capabilities are at the heart of the  capabilities approach, and are necessary to ensure  the achievement of equity concerns in international  and national policy decisions. Nevertheless,  international policymaking within the UNFCCC is  largely concerned with agreements among nations  and requires some degree of comparing capabilities  among countries.  While the capabilities of individuals and nations  are very different, they are also related and can be  mutually supportive. The capabilities of a nation  are a product of the capabilities of its individual  citizens, and conversely, individuals’ capabilities are  embedded within the broader social system, which  is facilitated or created by the nation.  In recognition of the socially embedded nature of  individual capabilities, this report proposes four  national capabilities. They provide a limited but  pragmatic starting point for considering capabilities  in the UNFCCC discussions. They relate to core  systems that enable individuals to achieve their  capabilities. The four national capabilities are:  human development, economic capacity, resilience  to climate impacts, and governance capacity and  social security structures. Together these four capabilities  can be used to craft a more robust framing  of “respective capabilities” than has previously been  developed. Each is described below as it relates to  climate change, along with possible metrics.  Human development  A country’s level of human development has long  been acknowledged as an important component of  its capabilities. The aggregate state of well-being of  a national population clearly affects what is possible  in terms of climate action, and what is needed in  terms of policies to enhance individual capabilities.  Aggregate well-being can include factors such  as health and education, levels of poverty, access  to energy sources, and gender equality. A range of  metrics has been used to describe human development,  the most common of which is the Human  Development Index; a metric that itself was based  on a capabilities approach. Other ways of representing  human development include aggregate  measurements of poverty—number of people living  on less than $2 a day, or people with insufficient  energy access—or through specialized metrics that  take other issues into account, such as the Gender  Inequality Index.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Economic capacity  Economic capacity has long been of central concern  in the discussion of capabilities. A country’s ability  to make the investments required for climate  mitigation or adaptation, or compensating for loss  and damage, is directly tied to its access to liquid  financial assets, its debt load, and overall fiscal  health. From the perspective of its citizens, issues  like employment, functioning local markets, and  access to credit may be crucial for the development  of capabilities. The economic costs to a country of  climate actions can be significant; what often goes  unexamined is the economic benefit a country can  derive from climate actions.  Resilience to climate impacts  Climate impacts can significantly reduce capabilities,  particularly of those who are most vulnerable  or least well off. Future generations also face  heightened risks from climate impacts. At the  national level, physical, social, and economic security  against climate change is an important element  of capabilities. A country that faces major threats  to its physical security or cultural heritage and  identity from climate change must divert resources  to address the issue and, if these efforts are insufficient,  to deal with the short- and long-term impacts  of loss and damage.  Governance capacity and social support structures  The ability of a national government to effectively  govern and make decisions within its territory,  regulate industries, provide adequate social support,  and provide access to justice for all citizens within  national borders, is a necessary condition for supporting  a wide range of individual capabilities. Effective  governance is also necessary to enable climate action  to be designed and implemented in ways that can both  meet climate goals and enhance capabilities.  For example, as countries face climate impacts,  investments in social support systems may provide  necessary development opportunities in vulnerable  communities. Similarly, sufficient governmental  capacity to conduct impact assessments and monitor  policy effectiveness is important in all forms of climate  action. The inclusion of governance capacity as a  national capability resonates with the long-standing  acknowledgment of the importance of capacity building  as a key element in enabling broad climate action.   Metrics for national capabilities  Countries, like individuals, have multiple capabilities;  a fact that poses challenges to developing  an aggregated measure. In Table 3, we suggest a  number of possible metrics that might be used in  assessing national capabilities.  Some metrics, such as countries’ Human Development  Index ratings, or income per capita, are  already available and can be compared easily.  Others, such as qualitative loss and damage risks to  cultural systems, or degree of governmental competence,  are more difficult to measure but they may  be no less essential to an adequate assessment of a  country’s overall ability to support the core systems  required for citizens to develop their capability  potential. We propose that countries should be  encouraged to use quantitative metrics where  appropriate and systematically recognize elements  that cannot easily be quantified and include them in  overall evaluations of national capabilities.  Common but Differentiated  Responsibilities and Respective  Capabilities  The principle of “common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities” (CBDRRC)  is fundamental to the UNFCCC, and to the  concept of operationalizing equity. To date, considerable  effort has been devoted to understanding  the implications of the “common but differentiated  responsibilities” component, but the “respective  capabilities” element has been less fully explored.  While a capabilities approach itself is not a theory  of justice, the concept of capabilities can be applied  within the international framework established by  the UNFCCC (Box 6). This report proposes that a  robust approach for assessing capabilities be used  alongside assessments of responsibility. Such an  approach would not replace concerns about responsibility,  but would offer an expanded framework for  discussing national capabilities, and for identifying  and supporting actions aimed at protecting the  most vulnerable, the poor, and future generations.  In the international climate context, this means that  countries with greater capabilities should take the  lead on climate action and actively support policies  and measures that have the potential to build the  capabilities of the most vulnerable or least well off.  The underlying argument is that equity is multifaceted  and makes multiple demands: global mitigation  and adaptation to address existing impacts is  essential for well-being now and in the future, and  efforts to support and implement climate action  should be shared with due consideration for both  responsibility and capabilities. Addressing climate  change need not impose only burdens; smart  climate policies could result in significant long-term  benefits. This multifaceted approach offers multiple  resources for supporting the political momentum  needed to achieve global climate stabilization and  build capabilities.

Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Using the Capabilities Approach  in a Climate Context  The capabilities approach, as it is understood at  both the individual and national levels, has four  elements that facilitate its use as a framework for  advancing equity in climate action: focus on the  most vulnerable and least well off, now and in the  future; address benefits as well as burdens; focus on  pathways of action; and effectively engage respective  capabilities. The elements are elaborated below.  Focus on the most vulnerable and least well off,  now and in the future  Using a capabilities approach maintains focus on  those who are most vulnerable or least well off,  now and in the future, regardless of where they are  located. Such an approach requires that significant,  and equal, attention be paid to adaptation, building  resilience, and addressing loss and damage. Applying  a capabilities approach allows these issues to be  addressed at the core, not the periphery, of climate  action. When looking at individual capabilities  and pathways for action, it stresses awareness of  differences in vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and  resources, even within communities.  Address benefits as well as burdens  The capabilities approach highlights the opportunities  that climate action has for human development.  For instance, developments in renewable energy  and energy efficiency have the potential to provide  rural electrification, which improves health and  economic opportunities for communities. Further-  The principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities and  respective capabilities (CBDR-RC)  is built on principle 7 of the Rio  Declaration on Environment and  Development, adopted in 1992 at  the United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development, but  finds expression in the UNFCCC in  Article 3; it also permeates the balance  of responsibilities between countries in  Article 4.  The phrase “respective capabilities”  suggests there are two bases  for differentiation–one based on  contribution to harm (responsibilities),  and the other based on capability to  take action (capabilities). It is implied  that such differentiation must be in  service of the common environmental  goal (Rajamani 2006).  This report does not suggest  that capabilities become the sole  framework for pursuing climate equity.  Responsibility for climate change,  including historical responsibility,  remains fundamental to shaping global  mitigation and adaptation efforts.  Acknowledging historical responsibility  for emissions is necessary because  it allows the inequity of cumulative  contributions of GHG emissions,  which have led to higher atmospheric  concentrations, to be explicitly  incorporated into the international  discussion of climate change. However,  responsibility alone cannot adequately  address either the issues raised by  inequitable climate impacts or the need  to share the benefits of climate action  and enhance human well-being.  Our proposal seeks to address  this limitation by augmenting the  principle of “respective capabilities”  with a capabilities approach that can  provide guidance for climate policy  and action. Individual and national  capabilities are separate but can be  viewed as reinforcing each other. The  capability of a country, and therefore  its ability to contribute to global climate  action, is a reflection of individual  and local capabilities. Policies  that build individual capabilities,  therefore, support the community and,  ultimately, the national system. The  evidence we present suggests that an  additional focus on the capabilities  of communities and countries will  help governments operationalize this  principle by designing climate policies  that actively promote equity and further  human development.  An emphasis on capabilities can  also underscore the ways in which  responsibility for emissions—  including historical responsibility—is  critically important. The emissions  that result in climate change are also  the cause of the climate impacts  that can erode the capabilities of the  poorest and most vulnerable. Adopting  this approach could, therefore, help  countries effectively address the  multiple dimensions of climate equity  and craft an effective and broadly  supported 2015 Agreement.  BOX 6 | A CAPABILITIES APPROACH AND THE PRINCIPLE OF COMMON BUT DIFFERENTIATED  RESPONSIBILITIES AND RESPECTIVE CAPABILITIES   more, climate-resilient agriculture has been shown  to improve food security while contributing to  global climate mitigation.  The increased potential for benefits, and opportunities  to build capabilities, necessarily adds a positive  new dimension to the climate equity debate.  Instead of overlooking this potential, a capabilities  approach asks, “how could the benefits from technological  or social innovation be used to further the  capabilities of those who have the least, or are most  vulnerable?” Conversely, capabilities can be damaged  by climate policies that are not well designed  or that have not addressed the needs of particular  communities. Either way, a capabilities approach  explicitly requires an assessment of the impact  on communities, in particular those that are most  vulnerable or least well off.  Focus attention on pathways of action  The capabilities approach encourages attention  to the specific opportunities, resources, and barriers  that either assist people to live with dignity,  or prevent them from doing so. Despite equity  being central to climate action, international equity  debates have too often ended in stalemate, with  few concrete suggestions for climate action. Many  international approaches to equity have relied on  high-level abstract metrics that are generalized  across all nations. There are good reasons for this,  since any attempt at creating a burden-sharing  arrangement needs ways of comparing countries.  However, dependence on such metrics can overlook  possibilities or pathways for action at national or  local levels.  Effectively engage respective capabilities  An understanding of capabilities and an acknowledgment  of the linkages between individual and  national capabilities benefits international policy  discussions by providing a means of more fully  comparing and evaluating the capabilities of different  countries. Defining national capabilities  provides a multidimensional framework for comparison  more suited to the diversity of countries  than are single metrics. If used within the principle  of CBDR-RC, national capabilities could provide  a pragmatic approach for comparing efforts and  contributions across countries.  Without transformation  toward low-carbon  and climate-resilient  development, future  generations who played  no part in generating  historic emissions will  have increased difficulty  in achieving wellbeing.  APPLYING THE  CAPABILITIES  APPROACH TO LOWCARBON  PATHWAYS  Climate actions that promote low-carbon energy pathways must also  build capabilities of those who are potentially most vulnerable. This  chapter examines case studies from 15 countries across five policy  areas of renewable energy deployment, carbon pricing, fossil-fuel  subsidy reform, low carbon transportation, and forest management  to draw some lessons on how climate policies enhance capabilities  and address equity. Based on these examples, we put forward  recommendations on what the role of international policies and  institutions could be and how the international community could  support national and local level low-carbon actions.   In this chapter the report examines case studies  from 15 countries, both developing and developed,  that exemplify how capabilities can be met while at  the same time pursuing a low-carbon pathway.  Although we distinguish between actions to promote  low-carbon energy pathways in this chapter  and actions to promote climate resilience in chapter  3, we recognize multiple overlaps between them in  policy areas ranging from forest protection to urban  planning. Indeed, sustainable development policies  often provide many benefits that include mitigation  and adaptation, as well as other social, economic,  and environmental objectives.  Five Key Policy Areas to Promote  Low-Carbon Pathways  Achieving adequate mitigation of emissions will  depend on the ability of countries to adopt lowcarbon  development pathways. However, to generate  international momentum and to contribute to  greater well-being, especially among those who are  most vulnerable or least well off, climate actions  must also build capabilities. Our case studies fall into  five key policy sectors: renewable energy deployment,  carbon pricing, fossil-fuel subsidy reform,  low-carbon transportation, and forest management.  In each of the five policy areas, we found that, with  effective policy design and sufficient enabling factors,  climate action can build individual capabilities.  Case studies from developed and developing countries  highlight the ways in which climate policies  can affect capabilities and equity in a diverse set of  circumstances. The lessons that emerge from these  local and regional policy efforts suggest strategies  for reorienting international policies to focus on  enabling low-carbon climate policies that simultaneously  enhance capabilities.  An overview of case studies is provided in Table 4.  We identified the linkages between each policy area  and the equity concerns and current challenges or  strategies for enhancing capabilities. In the last  part of the chapter we identify possible roles for  international policies and institutions in supporting  concrete actions in this area.  Renewable Energy Access, Deployment,  and Innovation  As the world faces growing energy demand, renewable  energy must play an increasing role if climate  stabilization goals are to be achieved. The energy  sector accounted for about 60 percent of total  global GHG emissions in 2012, and energy-related  GHG emissions have been rising. Moreover, fossil  fuels accounted for over 80 percent of global energy  consumption in 2012 (IEA 2013a) . Achieving the  2oC warming limit will require a profound transformation  of energy systems through steep declines in  carbon intensity across all sectors of the economy  (IDDRI and SDSN 2014).  In spite of the dominance of fossil fuels, in 2010  an estimated 1.3 billion people did not have access  to modern energy services, and almost 2.7 billion  people relied on traditional biomass for cooking  (IEA 2011). Over 95 percent of people without  access to modern energy services live in developing  countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and  Asia, and roughly 84 percent live in rural areas (IEA  2011; Ballesteros et al. 2013). A capability perspective  requires attention to both mitigation and  energy access, and increasing renewable energy is a  key strategy for achieving this.  Table 4 | Five Policy Areas Drawn from Case  Studies Focus on Low-Carbon Pathways  POLICY AREA FEATURED COUNTRIES    Renewable Energy and Capabilities  Access to reliable, safe, and affordable energy is an  essential element in securing a range of capabilities.  Increasing household electrification, especially  if it replaces the use of traditional biomass, can  significantly contribute to health and education and  free up time for other pursuits (Torres-Duque et al.  2008; Fullerton, Bruce, and Gordon 2008; Palit and  Chaurey 2011; Köhlin et al. 2011). Energy access at  power levels sufficient for productive uses, such as  in cottage industries, can also support local employment  and financial well-being (EUEI and GIZ 2011).  In rural or remote regions, renewable electrification  can be more cost effective than conventional  grid extension and, in some situations, may be the  only practical option. In 2010, the International  Energy Agency (IEA) assessment of energy access  suggested that the most cost-effective electrification  for 70 percent of rural, remote areas would be  through off-grid or micro-grid systems, more than  90 percent of which would be powered by renewables  (IEA 2011). For this reason, the IEA suggested  that 64 percent of investment in energy access  would have to go to off-grid and mini-grid solutions  (primarily renewables) if universal energy access  was to be achieved by 2030.  Renewable energy sources could offer long-term  energy security and affordability benefits because  they are insulated from world energy price  increases and volatility. For instance, in Bangladesh,  where 75 percent of rural people lack electricity,  a public-private partnership is offering affordable  solar electric systems for homes (Box 7).  Figure 5 | Key Approaches for Building  Capabilities through Low-Carbon   Upfront costs  Renewables can present lower costs and more  reliable energy than traditional fossil-based electricity  sources, especially in the long run, but they  usually require significant upfront investments  that can limit access, especially to those who  are least well off (IEA 2011). Small-scale energy  entrepreneurs have developed creative financing  for low-income households. Such innovations  have included loans to traditionally “nonbanking”  populations (Box 8), subsidy and loan combinations  and pay-as-you go systems (Omwansa and  Sullivan 2014). Key lessons from such efforts have  included the importance of facilitating finance for  Electricity access has been increasing in Bangladesh, but  roughly 47 percent of the population still lacked access  (Hamid 2012; Urmee, Harries, and Schlapfer 2009; Kabir,  Dey, and Faraby 2010), and roughly 75 percent of people in  rural areas lacked access to energy (Hoque and Das 2013).  Over 80 percent of the country’s electricity is generated  with natural gas, but domestic supplies are insufficient  to meet Bangladesh’s current and growing demand  for energy (Baten et al. 2009). As a result, Bangladesh  imports fossil fuels, the cost of which strains the  country’s foreign reserves (Hamid 2012).  The Infrastructure Development Company Limited  (IDCOL), a public-private entity, initiated a rural  solar energy program, with funding from a variety of  international development agencies, in 2002 (Urmee,  Harries, and Schlapfer 2009; Kabir, Dey, and Faraby  2010). IDCOL works with partner organizations that  interact directly with consumers. IDCOL provides a  small subsidy and loan to partner organizations that,  in turn, extend credit to people who buy their solar  home systems. Partner organizations are incentivized to  ensure their solar home systems are well-built and well-maintained  (Kabir, Dey, and Faraby 2010; Arc Finance  2014). A typical solar home system costs $155 and  provides enough power for several lights and a television  set (Hamid 2012; Kabir, Dey, and Faraby 2010). These  systems reduced women’s burdens in the household (for  example, fetching water or cooking became much easier  and less time-consuming with access to electricity). With  time freed from household duties and electricity to light  their homes after dark, women were also able to engage  in income-generating activities such as sewing or poultry  farming (Kabir, Dey, and Faraby 2010; Hoque and Das  2013; Hamid 2012).  Several factors contributed to the success of the  program. These include:  ▪▪International financial support extended not only as  a capital subsidy but also as low-interest loans that  ultimately were extended to consumers.  ▪▪The “incentive structure” of the program, which  ensured effective after-sales service of the systems.  ▪▪Adequate administrative support and oversight from  IDCOL.  ▪▪Affordability of the products to consumers in terms  of total costs and repayment schemes matching the  structure of their income.  ▪▪Successful mobilization of partner social enterprises  that rapidly expanded to reach millions of customers.  BOX 7 | RURAL ELECTRICITY ACCESS  IN BANGLADESH  Selco India, founded in 1995, is a for-profit organization  that aims to provide electricity and, especially, lighting for  India’s rural and urban poor, mostly through photovoltaic  solar power (Selco 2014). Selco uses a no-subsidy  approach in which it helps arrange loans for poor  customers who lack significant savings so they can pay  for their lighting or energy supply themselves. Selco’s  products have benefited over half a million people in more  than 80,000 households and, in 2005, Selco’s revenue  was US$3 million (Bazilian et al. 2012), demonstrating  the long-term viability of its financial model.  In one case, Selco worked with a female entrepreneur  to provide portable lanterns for historically vulnerable  tribes in the Kutch district of Gujarat. The tribes’ location  was too remote for members to take regular long trips to  make loan payments. Instead, one loan to buy lanterns  for all the tribal households was made to a single female  entrepreneur, who then delivered the lanterns and made  payments on the loan (Selco 2014). According to Selco,  it is “essential to leverage the expertise of local financial  institutions to make the initial cost of solar energy  service affordable: not by lowering the capital cost but  by creating financial products that match the cash flow of  the client” (Selco 2014, 4–5).  Selco’s innovative approach to financing is at least  as important as its solar technology (Bazilian et al.  2011; IEA 2011). Selco’s approach to expanding  access to energy, particularly its financing innovations,  demonstrates that it is possible to expand access to  energy, even in remote, rural areas, without accelerating  climate change.  BOX 8 | INNOVATIVE FINANCING FOR  RURAL ELECTRICITY IN INDIA  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up very low-income or seasonally employed workers  (and such facilitation includes capacity building  within financial institutions), and understanding  the finance opportunities of individuals and communities.  Even with these systems, however, reaching  very poor populations remains challenging. For  instance, with pay-as-you-go systems, people living  in poverty face the constant threat of disruptions to  their energy supply.  Some developed countries have started programs to  improve low-income households’ access to renewable  energy systems and employment opportunities.  For example, the California Solar Initiative, which  began in 2006, includes employment training in  renewable energy and installation of renewables for  low-income households (California Public Utilities  Commission 2014) (Box 9) .  Third-party power purchase agreements have been  used to allow households to avoid upfront solar  costs, although these agreements are aimed at consumers  already capable of paying for grid electricity.  Finding ways to address upfront costs can expand  access to the benefits of renewables at both the individual  and national levels (which, in turn, provides  a range of benefits important for individual capabilities,  including improved air quality, energy security,  and long-term price certainty). For example, in  the face of a growing economy and limited domestic  fossil fuel resources, Ghana has been attempting to  expand its renewable energy capacity (Ghana 2011).  This strategy includes developing the 155 megawatt  Nzema concentrated solar power plant. However,  finance has remained challenging and this project  depends on significant overseas investment  (Clover 2014). For countries with limited financial  resources, there is a need for international support  to overcome upfront costs of large-scale renewable  energy deployment.  Colocating renewable energy generation  Renewable energy systems, especially in large-scale  deployments, can have disadvantages, such as noise  from wind farms or the cost of new transmission  lines from areas of high-wind-potential to areas of  high population. Many renewables require large  areas of land, which might be difficult and expensive  to access, and renewable energy installations can  result in habitat loss—for example, in sensitive high-altitude  slopes suitable for wind farms—or competitive  use of agricultural land and water resources; for  example, in areas used for biomass. In many cases,  the communities most impacted by the development  of renewable energy sources are not its final  consumers. These inequities in distribution of the  benefits and burdens of renewables can erode public  support for renewables generation (Devine-Wright  2005; Wolsink 2007). Colocating the production  and use of renewables, wide public engagement, and  ensuring transparent economic benefit sharing from  renewable production can erode some of these equity  concerns. Renewable energy cooperatives represent  an institutional innovation that has been proposed  to connect costs and benefits of large-scale energy  production and help to create a more equitable,  and more publicly acceptable, model of renewable  generation (see Box 10).  The falling cost of solar photovoltaic panels has made  them economically competitive with electricity rates  over the long run in some jurisdictions, and their  installation can result in household economic savings.  As of mid-2011, the majority of Californian residential  solar photovoltaic installations are arranged through  third-party companies in power purchase agreements.  In these agreements, a third party owns and maintains  the solar panels, and households commit to a long-term  electricity price that is either competitive with, or slightly  lower than their current price of electricity from the grid.  These arrangements, and their potential for long-term  household savings, have contributed to a doubling  of installed Californian residential solar photovoltaic  capacity between 2011 and 2013 (EIA 2014a). Power  purchase agreements have allowed a greater diversity  of people—including lower income people traditionally  excluded from such long-term investments—to benefit  from long-term solar power savings, while helping  California meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets.  BOX 9 | SOLAR POWER IN  CALIFORNIA, USA   Equitable public finance to support renewables  The design of public policies to support renewables  can effectively address equity concerns. For example,  feed-in tariffs (FITs) have caused particular  concern because they can cause electricity prices  to rise due to less grid users–but grid infrastructure  costs remaining static. Under a FIT scheme,  producers of renewable sources of electricity are  offered a long-term contract, which typically guarantees  a set price, or a scheduled suite of prices, for  the power they will produce and sell to the electrical  grid. Low-income customers often are more  affected by price increases because energy usually  accounts for a larger proportion of their budgets.  Low-income households, in some cases, also face  higher energy needs because of poor quality housing  and the use of older, less efficient appliances.  One of the important strategies for more equitable  direction of public energy finance is to ensure that  the needs of lowest income and most vulnerable  populations are understood and taken into consideration  during decision-making. This can take the  form of needs-assessment or demand-characterization  studies that specifically identify the most  pressing needs and the resources and opportunities  available to community members (see Box 11).  Wind power has a long history in Denmark, but the  1973 oil crisis stimulated interest in large-scale wind-energy  production (Tranaes n.d.;Mendonça, Lacey, and  Hvelplund 2009). The Danish government supported  cooperatives through policies such as a 30 percent  subsidy for new wind energy projects and feed-in tariff  (FIT) policies (Mendonça, Lacey, and Hvelplund 2009).  Although communities in other countries often  oppose new wind power projects because of visual  and noise impacts, Danish communities have tended  to support them. This is often attributed to the  cooperative ownership structure, which tightens the  relationship between benefits and burdens of renewable  generation, and actively involves communities in energy   decision-making. In a cooperative structure, those who  have to bear the aesthetic and environmental burdens  of wind power also receive financial or energy benefits  from these projects. In addition, individuals have greater  opportunities to participate in  decision-making, which  has reduced tensions about equity and generated wider  support (Devine-Wright 2005; Sørensen, Hansen, and  Larsen 2002).  BOX 10 | DENMARK’S WIND ENERGY  COOPERATIVES  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Carbon Pricing  Climate change is partly a result of market failure.  GHG emissions cause negative impacts but the  costs of these impacts are excluded from the markets  that created them. Thus individuals, companies,  and countries have little financial incentive to  reduce their emissions. Carbon pricing attempts to  remedy this situation by assigning a price to GHG  emissions, typically either through a carbon tax or  by creating a cap-and-trade market.  Carbon pricing can aid mitigation and, if well  designed, can provide positive benefits for consumers  (Preston et al. 2013). There is a large potential  for increased use of carbon pricing as a strategy for  achieving emission reductions and the associated  monetary and non-monetary co-benefits (World  Bank and EcoFys 2013).  Carbon Pricing, Co-benefits, and Capabilities  Carbon pricing shifts the incentive structure for  routine economic decisions to support the mitigation  efforts that will be required to protect long-term  capabilities. As greenhouse gases tend to be emitted  along with other pollutants, reducing emissions can  also improve air quality and human health, which  also contribute to human well-being. Low-income  residents are particularly susceptible to poor air  quality because many live near polluting industries,  and because the health care costs of air pollution may  be relatively more onerous. Environmental justice  studies have consistently found that marginalized  communities tend to have higher exposure to industrial  pollutants, and are less likely to be meaningfully  involved in local  decision-making about facilities siting  or management (Cole and Foster 2001; Bullard 1997).  Carbon pricing can also create benefits beyond climate  change mitigation and improved air quality. Increased  energy costs have systematically been linked to higher  economy-wide energy efficiency (Grubb 2014). Over  time, higher energy efficiency leads to significant  savings. For instance, the Regional Greenhouse Gas  Initiative trading scheme among power plants in the  northeastern United States is expected to save the  region over $2 billion in lifetime energy costs (RGGI  2014). Increased efficiency can also help reduce  national vulnerability to fuel-price volatility, a particular  concern for many developing countries.  Carbon pricing, either as a tax or as a permit  auction, can also generate government revenue  for other national priorities. For example, the  US$1.7 billion in auction revenues generated by the  Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the United  States since 2008 has funded energy efficiency and  clean technology development, and reduced customers’  electricity bills (RGGI 2014). In California,  auction revenues support a range of services including  community development and public transportation  (California 2014). Similarly, the carbon tax  in Ireland (Box 12) has allowed the government  to minimize increases in income or employment  taxes, which tend to slow economic recovery, while  increasing resources for low-income residents  (Convery, Dunne, and Joyce 2013).  Facing a predicted doubling of energy demand within  20 years (Chrometzka 2014) and limited domestic fossil  fuel resources, Thailand was one of the first Asian  countries to pursue renewable energy development. In  2013, the country unveiled one of the region’s most  ambitious solar photovoltaic targets, aiming to produce  3,000 megawatts by 2021 (TSRM2013). Thailand initially  included a feed-in tariff (FIT) featuring a generous  premium for renewable energy, but this proved so  attractive that it created a “solar gold rush” and more  proposed capacity than expected. The Ministry of Energy  became concerned that, if the government’s official target  of 500 megawatts were to be exceeded, there would be a  sharp increase in the pass-through costs to consumers  (Graecen and Tongsopit 2013).  To rebalance its policy and better direct the benefits of  solar power generation to individual households and  communities who had initially been excluded from the  policy’s benefits, the new FIT design includes explicit  rates and targets both for residential rooftop solar, and  community photovoltaic systems. Aims of this program  include greater residential income-sharing benefits, in  addition to higher employment and community financial  benefits. Financing was provided through the Thai Village  Fund (Tongsopit 2014; Chrometzka 2014). Extending  the policy to the community was particularly designed to  help individuals who could benefit only by participating  as members of a group; the policy redesign demonstrated  a strong desire to address some equity concerns of the  original policy. However, funding, especially for the  low-interest loans initially included in the community  projects, has presented an ongoing challenge, and has  slowed the roll-out of the program (TSRM 2014).  BOX 11 | FEED-IN-TARIFF IN THAILAND   Strategies for Equitable Carbon Pricing  Carbon pricing policies can have negative effects on  the poor but, with careful design, they can achieve  progressive impacts.  Minimizing regressive impacts  Carbon pricing tends to increase energy prices,  creating some equity challenges. People with lower  incomes typically use less energy, but energy expenditures  usually constitute a larger proportion of their  budgets. Fortunately, carbon pricing need not be  regressive. For instance, British Columbia’s carbon  tax provided income tax reductions to low-income  residents to compensate them for increased energy  prices (British Columbia 2009). A variety of compensation  schemes can be used to make carbon pricing  result in progressive outcomes (Preston et al. 2013).  Companies may also face unequal difficulties in the  face of carbon pricing schemes. A common challenge,  especially in some developing countries, is  that energy entities can have a wide range of operating  efficiencies. India’s energy efficiency policy for  industry assigned plant-specific targets, encouraging  a process of long-term, system-wide efficiency  gains without threatening local employment and  development (Box 13).  In late 2008, Ireland suffered a severe fiscal crisis and  negotiated a bailout with the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund. As part of its austerity  measures, Ireland dramatically reduced expenditures and  raised taxes. Ireland imposed a carbon tax of €15 per  metric ton of CO2 on transport fuels in late 2009 and then  extended this tax to nontransport liquid fuels in 2010.  In 2012, the tax increased to €20 per metric ton of CO2  (Gargan 2012).  Between 2010 and 2012, the cumulative revenue  from Ireland’s carbon tax was €919 million. Although  revenue from the tax provided only about 1 percent  of the government’s tax revenues, it constituted 12.4  percent of the increase in tax revenues demanded by  the austerity agreements over this period (Convery,  Dunne, and Joyce 2013). The carbon tax allowed the  government to minimize increases in labor and income  taxes and helped protect the economy and citizens from  austerity measures. To address fuel poverty and equity  concerns, the government set aside revenues to expand  weatherization and energy efficiency programs for lowincome  residents (Convery, Dunne, and Joyce 2013).  Populations who were considered especially vulnerable  to price increases, and who had limited alternative  options (for example, farmers) were given partial relief  from their tax liability.  BOX 12 | IRELAND’S CARBON TAX  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Carbon pricing can generate economic benefits –  including government revenue – that can be used to  secure progressive outcomes. Revenue from carbon  pricing can be used to reduce other specific taxes,  or to reduce general taxation to spur aggregate  economic growth (Sumner, Bird, and Smith 2009).  Revenues can also be directed to communities with  particular needs, in the form of cash transfers or inkind  provisions (for example, public transit or community  development). The California cap-and-trade  system (Box 14) explicitly sets aside 25 percent of the  revenue to be used to benefit disadvantaged communities,  almost half of which (10 percent of total  revenues) must be invested directly in these communities  while the rest can be used for investments  elsewhere that benefit the community residents. This  has resulted in investments in public transportation,  local development, and weatherization for lowincome  residents’ housing (California 2014).  India’s Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme, conceived  in 2008 and implemented in 2011, is the first market-based  energy-efficiency trading scheme in a developing country  (Singh 2013). The Indian government established the PAT  scheme to improve energy security, reduce energy deficits,  and make India’s industries more competitive.  In the 478 facilities it covers, the scheme aims to reduce  energy consumption by 4.8 percent, equivalent to about  6.6 million metric tons of oil (Diddi 2011; Singh 2013).  Each facility receives an energy-consumption-reduction  target. Each entity receives tradable-energy-savings  credits if it achieves reductions beyond its target, and  those that fall short must buy credits to make up the  difference (Bureau of Energy Efficiency 2011).  Two relevant issues with equity implications are that  industrial entities across India vary substantially in their  energy efficiency, and employment is always of concern.  Based on extensive workshops, meetings, and stakeholder  consultations, it was decided to give each plant a unique  energy-efficiency target based on its baseline energy  usage to avoid severe hardship, and potential shutdown.  A large number of national consultants were trained and  supported to gather energy-use data from all plants. One  important benefit of this scheme from a national capability  perspective has been greater domestic capacity in energy-efficiency  monitoring (Singh 2013).  From a capabilities perspective this case is interesting  both because of the extensive efforts made to include  stakeholders’ perspectives about policy implications,  and the way in which the specific circumstances of  each installation were taken into account. Given the  context of large variations in efficiency, the approach  facilitated broad participation and attempted to limit  targets that might have resulted in undesirable impacts  for capabilities, such as sudden employment losses.  Conversely, it remains possible that some communities  will continue to face burdens from local air pollution  associated with lower efficiency plants. It will be  necessary to see how both efficiencies and community  impacts change over time.  BOX 13 | INDIA’S PERFORM, ACHIEVE,  AND TRADE SCHEME  The U.S. State of California aims to reduce its GHG  emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In 2006, California  passed the Global Warming Solutions Act, which  required the state to develop a scoping plan for  emission reductions, identify and monitor statewide  GHGs, establish a market-based system to achieve GHG  reductions, create an economic and technical board, and  create an environmental justice advisory board (California  2006). Based on its scoping plan, the state chose to use a  cap-and-trade system to drive emission reductions.  Initially, the California system was second only to the  European Union Emissions Trading Scheme in terms  of the quantity of total emissions covered, though it  has since been overtaken by the aggregate emissions  coverage of China’s five trading systems (Song and  Lei 2014). The California system is designed to reduce  emissions by 16 percent between 2013 and 2020  (California 2011). The program covers approximately 394  million tons of CO2, which represents approximately 85  percent of California’s total CO2 emissions.  Partly due to the advocacy of the environmental justice  community, and the inclusion of an environmental justice  advisory board, California’s cap-and-trade program  now aims to protect local communities’ well-being. It  requires that at least 25 percent of revenues be invested  in projects that benefit disadvantaged communities,  a portion of which must be spent directly in these  communities (California 2012). Examples include  investments in public transit, weatherization for lowincome  residents’ housing, and advances in freight  management to decrease local air pollution from freight  hubs (California 2014).  BOX 14 | CALIFORNIA’S GLOBAL  WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT   Distributing Nonmonetary Co-benefits  Carbon pricing can also lead to nonmonetary  co-benefits. Some benefits, such as reduced air  pollution and improved human health, emerge as  byproducts of lower emissions, but permit systems  can also be designed so that certain developments  or social benefits are built into the definition of  permits or offsets. For example, several pricing  schemes have defined credits or offsets to include  a range of development criteria. Some of these  schemes exist in the voluntary carbon market (Gold  Standard 2013), the Clean Development Mechanism,  and REDD+.1 In all these cases, permits or  offsets were explicitly defined to include social and/  or environmental benefits (Mathur et al. 2014).  Fossil-Fuel Subsidy Reform  Fossil-fuel subsidies lead to higher GHG emissions  and divert resources away from development priorities.  According to the International Monetary Fund  (IMF), all countries subsidize fossil fuels, although  the form and size of subsidies vary considerably  (IMF 2013, 201). The International Energy Agency  (IEA) estimates that global pretax subsidies for  the production and consumption of fossil fuels are  Two general types of fossil-fuel subsidy are pretax  subsidies and tax subsidies. Pretax subsidies are typically  consumer subsidies that reduce the price of fossil fuels  directly. They are commonly measured by comparing  domestic fossil-fuel prices to international fossil-fuel  prices. Using this method, the International Energy  Agency (IEA) estimated global subsidies at $523 billion  in 2011 (IEA 2012). Pretax subsidies are widely used,  particularly in developing countries, to protect domestic  consumers from high or volatile world energy prices.  Tax subsidies are common in producer states, including  many developed countries, and often aim to support  domestic oil and gas sectors. Tax subsidies are typically  located upstream from direct consumers and can include  a wide range of actions including in-kind support of  oil and gas exploration, or accelerated depreciation for  equipment or assets to minimize corporate tax liabilities.  Tax subsidies can be more difficult to measure than  pretax subsidies because they are more diverse and  because the cost of tax subsidies includes broader fiscal  implications of inefficient taxation. For example, a pretax  subsidy calculation would not include the negative  impacts of pollution, but a tax subsidy would. In a 2013  International Monetary Fund study, the calculation for  tax subsidies includes a US$25 per tonne of carbon  emission as the social cost of carbon. When such  impacts are included, the overall cost of tax and pretax  subsidies is enormous—over $1.9 trillion in 2011  by one estimate, or roughly 8 percent of total global  government revenue (IMF 2013).  Because fossil-fuel subsidies take many forms,  transparent measurement is extremely difficult, and data  are missing for many countries (OECD 2011). Many  governments do not have accurate information about  their own fossil-fuel subsidies (IMF 2013; IEA 2011).  It is even less likely that citizens and communities are  aware of the costs of subsidies. Based on the idea that  understanding subsidies increases public support for  reforming them, several attempts at subsidy reform have  featured public communication strategies. By extension,  improving international transparency about subsidies  should support national efforts to reform subsidies  (Victor 2009a; OECD 2011).  BOX 15 | THE CHALLENGES OF  MEASURING FOSSIL-FUEL SUBSIDIES  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up approximately $523 billion annually (IEA 2012).  This figure is conservative and it could be much  higher, depending on how subsidies are measured.  The IEA also estimated that global removal of  pretax fossil-fuel subsidies would reduce global CO2  emissions by approximately 2 gigatons, or 4 percent  of total emissions, annually (IEA 2012).  In 2009, leaders in the Group of 20 (G-20) committed  to gradually phasing out subsidies but recognized  that poor communities might still need assistance  (G-20 2009). In 2011, the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation leaders followed suit and additionally  promised to establish a voluntary reporting system  for fossil-fuel subsidies (APEC 2011).  Fossil-Fuel Subsidies and Capabilities  Fossil-fuel subsidies are important from a capabilities  perspective because of their economy-wide  effects and impacts on fossil-fuel use.  Fossil-fuel subsidies divert money from development  Fossil-fuel subsidies divert resources from other  national priorities. For instance, Yemen’s government  spent over 20 percent of its budget on  fossil-fuel subsidies in 2009—more than it spent on  education, health, and social protection programs  combined (Breisinger, Engelke, and Ecker 2011).  Similarly, at the peak of global energy prices in  2008, Indonesia’s government spent roughly 22  percent of its budget on consumer-oriented fossil-fuel  subsidies (Mourougane 2010).  The most vulnerable members of society are likely  to be the most dependent on public services in the  face of climate change, so reduced public support  for services like education, affordable public transit,  and health care affects them—and their core capabilities—  particularly strongly. At the same time,  without clear increases in public supports and cash  transfers, and active engagement of the public, subsidy  removal is difficult because it can be seen as an  erosion of support for the poor. Development and  capabilities benefits must be apparent in subsidy  reforms if they are to be successful. In Indonesia,  attempts to eliminate energy subsidies raised strong  opposition for many years (Box 16). Conversely, in  Iran, a broad public communications campaign was  a crucial element of the reform process (Box 17).  Subsidies benefit middle- and upper-income  people most  Although subsidies are often implemented to protect  the well-being of the poor, middle- and upper-income  people have benefited most from fossil-fuel  subsidies. One study of fossil-fuel subsidies in 20  countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin  America found that only US$3 out of every US$100  reached the poorest 20 percent of the population  (Arze del Granado, Coady, and Gillingham 2012).  Indonesia first attempted fossil-fuel subsidy reforms  after the 1997 Asian crisis, but the reforms were too  sudden and sweeping, resulting in widespread political  unrest (Beaton and Lontoh 2010). From 2000 to 2003,  the Indonesian government continued its attempts to  reduce subsidies, but problems with the compensation  mechanisms and widespread political mistrust eroded  public support. In 2005, the government attempted to  reform subsidies again. The 2005 reform included a  cash-transfer program, increased access to health care  for poor households, and reduced school fees. Subsidies  to large, industrial electricity consumers were also  stopped (IMF 2013). However, even after these reforms,  subsidies still cost Indonesia about 4.5 percent of its  GDP. The remaining subsidies are regressive, and they  have eroded utilities’ ability to invest in electrification and  other upgrades. This failure continues to contribute to  energy access challenges, particularly in remote island  areas (Chung 2013; Mourougane 2010).  New reforms were initiated in 2008, along with cash  transfers, a food-security program, and support for  education (Beaton and Lontoh 2010). However, by  2013, government spending on energy subsidies was  again greater than its spending on health, education,  housing, environmental protection, and social protection  combined (Chung 2013), so the government initiated  another round of reforms (EIA 2014b). Modeling  has suggested that fully removing subsidies could  dramatically increase GDP and reduce poverty  (Mourougane 2010). Although phasing out subsidies  remains a work in progress, Indonesia joined other G-20  countries in their pledge to achieve this goal. This case  highlights the challenges of national subsidy reform:  public acceptance and support is crucial and may be best  generated through active involvement.  BOX 16 | INDONESIA’S ATTEMPTS TO  PHASE OUT SUBSIDIES   These disparities across income groups hold even  when the indirect benefits of lower fuel prices,  such as lower food costs, are considered (Arze del  Granado, Coady, and Gillingham 2012). This suggests  that, while energy subsidies are often justified  to protect the poor, other strategies would actually  make more effective use of limited resources.  The inequities inherent in fossil-fuel subsidies are  easily observed: for example, over 44 percent of  the money spent on petroleum-product subsidies  in Africa goes to the top quintile, only 7 percent  reaches the poorest quintile (Coady et al. 2010).  However, although the poor gain relatively little  from direct subsidies, the small benefit that subsidies  provide remains crucial to them, especially if  subsidies are targeted at cooking fuels such as kerosene.  Additionally, the poor may be more dependent  on public services, which, in turn, are eroded  by the diversion of limited government revenues to  fossil-fuel subsidies. Many countries that remove  subsidies have tried to minimize the negative consequences  of higher energy prices for low-income  families by using cash-transfers or improving public  services such as education or health care.  Fossil-fuel subsidies impede energy efficiency and  long-term growth  Fossil-fuel subsidies can reduce energy efficiency  and impede long-term growth. In parts of Sub-  Saharan Africa, electricity production costs are  extremely high and suppliers are often unable to  fully recoup investments because of subsidized  prices. Over time, this has led to insufficient investment  in electricity infrastructure, which has exacerbated  ongoing challenges to energy access, growth,  and employment (IMF 2013). High subsidies also  lead to energy inefficiency because prices are too  low to encourage efficiency improvements or infrastructure  reinvestments. High subsidies and inefficiency  have been ongoing challenges in the Middle  East and North Africa (Fattouh and El-Katiri 2013).  In fossil-fuel producing countries, subsidies lead to  artificially low prices that can contribute to higher  domestic consumption and foregone government revenue  because fuel is consumed domestically instead of  being exported. For example, Iran has become a net  importer of gasoline (Hessari 2005), in part because  of its high levels of subsidy and low levels of efficiency.  Because domestic prices are subsidized, the country  generates less revenue through domestic sales than  they would if the same fuel were exported to the international  market. Instead of generating revenue, gasoline  imports have imposed a heavy financial burden  on Iran, leaving less revenue for investments in other  areas essential to capabilities. In general, evidence is  growing that fossil-fuel subsidies impede long-term  growth; studies of post-subsidy reform periods show  higher rates of economic growth (Breisinger, Engelke,  and Ecker 2011).  The Iranian case exemplifies a careful effort to  protect well-being and long-term capabilities at the  individual level during a major reform of fossil-fuel  subsidies. The need for strong communications and  banking systems were highlighted to facilitate such  profound reforms.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Low-Carbon Transportation Planning  Nearly all people depend on access to transportation  to achieve a range of capabilities. Sustainable  transportation policies can provide numerous  benefits, simultaneously reducing carbon dioxide  and other air pollutant emissions, reducing poverty,  improving public health, and enhancing the  overall resilience and adaptability of communities  in the face of climate change. Increasing mobility  and reducing CO2 emissions need not be mutually  exclusive goals; well-coordinated policies can lead  to both low-carbon transitions in the transportation  sector and greater access to mobility services.  Transportation and Capabilities  A lack of mobility can reduce access to education,  livelihoods, health care, public participation  and social engagement, to name just a few of  the capabilities at stake. For vulnerable groups,  especially the poor, the lack of access to a reliable,  efficient, and affordable means of transportation is  a serious burden. Transportation was the second  largest source of CO2 emissions worldwide in 2012,  accounting for almost a quarter of global CO2 emissions  from fuel consumption (IEA 2013b). Carbon  dioxide emissions from transportation are growing  at an average rate of 1.7 percent per year and,  In 2010, Iran embarked on the first  major subsidy-reform program  undertaken by an oil-exporting  country. In 2008, the price of domestic  (subsidized) gasoline was only 5  percent of the unsubsidized world price  (Guillaume, Farzin, and Zytek 2011).  As international oil prices skyrocketed,  high domestic consumption resulted  in lost export revenues and domestic  production companies could barely  cover their operating costs, let alone  invest in efficiency improvements.  The 2010 Reform Act caused dramatic  increases in retail prices for all energy  sources (Guillaume, Farzin, and Zytek  2011). A sevenfold price increase for  petrol occurred overnight (See Table  B17.3 for details). Initially, 50 percent  of the revenues received through the  reform were earmarked to compensate  households. Each household received  a designated bank account with a  cash-transfer deposited in it before  the price increase was announced.  Simultaneously, the government spread  information about the subsidy reform,  and, to deter hoarding, the government  publicized its stockpile of fuel that could  be released into the market if necessary.  Despite the detailed planning, the  Iranian reforms have faced significant  challenges. It proved difficult to identify  low-income households accurately  and almost 80 percent of households  received cash transfers, resulting in  reduced revenue for the government.  High inflation has since reduced the  value of cash transfers, especially  for Iran’s poorest (Hassanzadeh  2012). A more targeted cash-transfer  compensation program has been  planned to help the least well off.  following a business-as-usual scenario, are projected  to increase by 70 percent by 2050 (United  Nations 2013). Most of this increase is projected  to come from developing countries, where rising  vehicle ownership has increased CO2 emissions  from transportation by over 60 percent between  2000 and 2012 (United Nations 2013).  Rapid growth in automobile use has contributed to  an estimated 1.24 million deaths per year. In 2012,  road traffic fatalities were the leading cause of death  for young people aged 15–29 and the eighth leading  cause of death overall (WHO 2013). Cars and trucks  emit fine particulate pollution, sulfur dioxide, black  carbon, and other toxins (United Nations 2013). In  the United States, for instance, levels of pollutants  tend to be highest in low-income areas and children  and the elderly are especially at risk from adverse  health effects or death as a result of air pollution  (Clark, Millet, and Marshall 2014).  Rapid growth in private vehicle use and poorly  designed roads and public transportation systems  have also led to congestion problems in major cities  around the world (United Nations 2013). It has been  estimated that congestion cost an estimated US$101  billion globally in lost productivity and decreased  fuel efficiency in 2010 (Replogle and Hughes 2012).  Enhancing Capabilities through Low-Carbon  Transportation  Increasing access to transportation is important  to combating poverty and providing people with  the means to seek better economic opportunities,  but greater access cannot be achieved simply by  building more roads. Poorly managed transportation  systems can create health and safety risks for  the people they are meant to serve, especially for  lower income groups and other vulnerable populations.  The traditional approach of building more  roads and optimizing the movement of vehicles, as  opposed to people and goods, has led to the exclusion  of large groups of people (United Nations  2013). For many developed and rapidly developing  countries, the costs created by carbon-intensive  growth of the transportation sector have been damaging,  especially in the cities where growth is centered.  Increasing levels of motorization are harmful  not only to public health, economic growth, and  overall well-being but also to the climate system.  A low-carbon transportation sector focused on public  transit offers a way to increase transportation—  including for the poor—while avoiding the short  and long-term negative implications of increased  transportation emissions, road traffic accidents, and  air pollutants. Several strategies have been pursued  to achieve these aims.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Increasing appropriate public transit  To curb motorization, especially in rapidly developing  countries where both population and personal  wealth are on the rise, a practical and attractive  alternative to private vehicles must be available.  Some national and local governments are choosing  to reform their transportation sectors through  policies that encourage public transportation use,  limit the number of cars on the roads, support  greater mobility and access for low-income and  other marginalized groups, and create a safer and  more pleasant travelling experience for everyone on  the roads.  For instance, the bus rapid transit system in  Bogota, Colombia (Box 18) has reduced air pollution,  increased public transportation availability  especially for lower-middle income groups, reduced  transportation health and safety impacts, and  resulted in economic benefits. An additional benefit  of a bus rapid transit system is that it can be more  cost-effective than rail-based systems.  Appropriate pricing and policy signals  Another strategy for supporting low-carbon transportation  development is to change underlying  price structures and planning processes to discourage  the growth of fossil-fuel based motorization.  Such efforts can include explicit planning and landuse  policies that prioritize low-carbon development  or mechanisms such as congestion charges that can  result in a range of benefits. For example, Istanbul’s  decision to pedestrianize part of its historic core  resulted in decreased pollution but also contributed  to economic growth from tourism.  In the United Kingdom, a congestion charge  imposed on the central zone of London almost  immediately resulted in a range of benefits: congestion,  air pollution, emissions, and traffic accidents  all decreased (Box 19). This policy also generated  income, which supported public transit systems  that are used particularly by low-income communities.  This policy shift required minimal public  investment, but did require a strong policy framework  and relied on widespread public engagement  and support.  Bogota’s bus rapid transit (BRT) system, TransMilenio,  is an example of how low-carbon transportation  development can have positive impacts, both on GHG  emissions and on the lives of a city’s residents. With  an estimated population of over 8 million in 2007,  and a high population density, Bogota suffered from  heavily congested roadways, high traffic fatalities, long  commuting times, and severe air pollution (Turner,  Kooshian, and Winkelman 2012). In conjunction with  restrictions on car traffic and improved bicycling  infrastructure, Bogota implemented the TransMilenio  system to address these issues. A benefit of using a  bus rapid transit was that it could be implemented less  expensively than a comparable rail system.  This system has a daily ridership of 2 million people, and  is the primary source of transportation for 30 percent  of Bogota’s residents (Bogotá Cómo Vamos 2013). The  improved fuel economy of TransMilenio buses has also  resulted in a 43 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2)  an 18 percent reduction in nitric oxide and nitrogen  dioxide (NOx), and a 12 percent reduction in particulate  matter. Traffic injuries along the TransMilenio corridor  were reduced by almost 40 percent and traffic fatalities  were reduced by almost 50 percent compared with the  pre-BRT system (Carrigan et al. 2013). Faster buses  have contributed to a 32 percent decrease in travel time  relative to the pre-BRT system for users (Echeverry,  Ibanez, and Hillon 2004). The areas around the BRT  corridor have benefited from increased property values  and an 85 percent reduction in crime relative to the pre-  BRT system because of increased lighting and security  measures (Carrigan et al. 2013).  A 2013 analysis by EMBARQ found that lower-income  residents most benefitted from the BRT, and ridership  on the TransMilenio tends to be highest in lower-middle  income groups (Carrigan et al. 2013). Feeder buses  provide low-income neighborhoods with access to main  trunk lines (Carrigan et al. 2013). However, the fare  remains too expensive for many of Bogota’s low-income  residents. The Bogota government has considered  subsidizing the fare price to make TransMilenio more  practical for poorer residents, but instead provided a  discounted fare during off-peak hours. This decision  may help alleviate overcrowding during peak hours  (Hutchinson 2011), but does not address the core equity  concern of access for low-income riders facing temporal  limits to affordable mobility.  BOX 18 | BOGOTA’S BUS RAPID TRANSIT   Community Forestry Management  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by  deforestation and forest degradation is central to  climate change mitigation. More than 13 million  hectares of forest are cleared every year, and forest  loss and degradation are the source of 12 percent  of all GHG emissions (Smith et al. 2014). Integrating  forest management into climate policy action is  an important mitigation strategy. However, access  to forest benefits and meaningful engagement in  forestry  decision-making is essential for ensuring  the capabilities of current and future forest  communities. When designed well, forestry and  climate policy can enhance the capabilities of  forest-dependent communities.  Forests and Capabilities  As sources of livelihoods, food, energy, spiritual  health, and shelter, as well as ecosystem services  such as water and climate regulation, forests are  essential to the capabilities of forest-dependent  communities directly as well as to many others indirectly.  The capabilities of those directly or indirectly  connected to forests depend on access to forest  benefits including timber and non-timber goods and  services. In addition, for those living in and around  forests, meaningful legal, political, social, and  economic engagement in forest management is a  core capability linked to social and political human  rights. Participation is also a central strategy to  achieve the range of other capabilities supported by  access to forest benefits.  The importance of forest health to human capabilities  extends beyond forest boundaries. For example,  over 90 percent of Ethiopians rely on wood for fuel.  By the early 2000s, fuelwood scarcity caused by  deforestation had resulted in increased used of animal  dung for fuel, with resulting decreases in agricultural  productivity (Bishaw and Abdelkadir 2003).  Household use of animal dung for fuel has also been  linked to negative health impacts from indoor air  pollution (Mudway et al. 2005). In addition, the  health of regional watersheds is essential for the  well-being of rural and urban populations—including  those along the Amazon, the Nile, and the Mekong—  and is intimately tied to forest vitality. In addition,  forests act as a global sink for CO2 emissions (or as a  source, in the case of deforestation and degradation);  forest health and regeneration are therefore key elements  in climate mitigation and protection of a wide  range of future capabilities.  Enhancing Capabilities and Climate Action  through Community Forestry  The close relationships between community capabilities,  forest health, and  decision-making authority  led to a widespread interest in community forestry  and indigenous peoples’ rights that started in the  1970s and 1980s. Led by efforts in countries such  as Brazil, Nepal, the Philippines, and India, it was  Long travelling times, air pollution, noise, and high rates  of traffic accidents were creating significant problems for  Londoners. In 2003, the City of London implemented a  congestion-pricing scheme within central London. Any  vehicle entering the congestion area during peak hours  is charged a fee. The fee was initially set at £5 and has  since increased to £11.50 to compete with rising public  transportation costs. Prior to implementation, the city  government established demonstration projects, held  public discussions, and publicized information about the  charge on television and in newspapers.  By 2005, traffic in central London had decreased by 20  percent and congestion was reduced by 30 percent, with  as many as 70,000 fewer vehicles within the congestion  area relative to the precongestion tax period (Willumsen  2004). An estimated 50–60 percent of drivers switched  to public transportation, 20–30 percent avoided the area,  and others switched to carpooling and bicycles (Sadler  n.d.). Journey times were reported to have decreased  by 14 percent (Beevers and Carslaw 2005; Transport for  London 2004). Meanwhile, CO2 emissions decreased  by almost 20 percent, and particulate matter and NOx  decreased by 12 percent (Beevers and Carslaw 2005). Bus  activity increased within the area but, thanks to improved  fuel economy in London’s new buses, emission levels did  not increase correspondingly (Anas and Lindsey 2011).  About half the revenue from the scheme is used to  improve public transportation, a service of particular  importance to low-income groups (Road Traffic  Technology n.d.). Early proposals to implement a carbon-emissions  pricing scheme that included a £25 charge for  high-emitting vehicles were rejected because the scheme  would have had the greatest negative impact on families  and small businesses (Tarry 2008).  BOX 19 | LONDON’S CONGESTION  PRICING SCHEME  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up argued that strengthening community forest rights  not only helps communities flourish by recognizing  their customary rights to forests that they depend  on, but also helps reduce deforestation and forest  degradation. This theory has largely been borne  out; it appears that community forestry both  enhances community capabilities and mitigates  climate change, provided that the community  enjoys strong legal rights that are supported and  protected by governments. Evidence from studies in  Africa, Latin America, and Asia suggests that forests  are healthiest when communities retain management  authority over them (Blomley 2013; Hayes  and Persha 2010; Persha, Agarwal, and Chhatre  2011). Several strategies have been used to increase  capabilities and forest health, avoid emissions, and  store carbon through community forestry.  Legal Rights to Forests for Communities  Protecting forests by strengthening the rights of forest  communities has been a central concern of forest  communities in South America, Southeast Asia, and  Africa. Evidence from a number of countries suggests  that strengthening those legal protections can be vital  both for enhancing equity and for mitigating climate  change. For example, in Brazil, forest loss is significantly  lower in legally recognized indigenous forests  than outside them (RRI 2014) (Box 20). Similarly,  recognition of legal land rights has been a crucial element  in recent reforestation and community development  successes in Ethiopia and Niger (RRI 2014).  A recent study measuring forest carbon in Asia and  Africa found that carbon storage in 30 community  forests increased by 4.9 metric tons per hectare per  year (on average) over three to four years (Skutsch  and Solis 2011). Yet communities currently have  official rights to only about one eighth of the world’s  forests (RRI 2014).  In Brazil, forests hold more than 63 billion metric tons of  carbon, much of it stored in community forests, including  legally recognized indigenous community forests (FAO  2010). Twenty-eight percent of Brazilian forest cover is  government-recognized community forest (RRI 2014).  Although several different types of legal rights for forest  communities are recognized under Brazilian law, by far  the largest legal category by area, is that of “Indigenous  Lands,” more than 300 of which have been legally  recognized (Davis 2013). In Indigenous Lands, resident  indigenous peoples have the legal right to manage the  forest, exclude outsiders, and benefit sustainably. Forest  loss has been 0.7 percent within Indigenous Lands  compared with 7 percent outside them. From 2000–12,  27 times more CO2 emissions were produced outside  Indigenous Lands than within them (Stevens et al. 2014).    Indigenous Lands  Brazilian Amazon  Highlighted Area (see left)  FOREST COVER AND DENSITY (2000)  Closed forests (canopy cover >45%)  Open forests (canopy cover 25-45%)  Woodlands (canopy cover <25%)  Figure 5 | Satellite-Detected Tree Cover Loss in Brazil, 2000-12, for Indigenous Lands in the  Southwest of the Brazilian Amazon  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Legal protections may also be needed to recognize  the use-rights of communities to benefit from forest  management. For instance, in Niger, the forest  service stopped fining farmers who cut branches or  otherwise managed trees on their farms, permitted  farmers to harvest and sell timber from their  trees, and allowed farmers to prevent others from  cutting trees (WRI 2008). This legal change facilitated  Niger’s forest protection process. It has been  demonstrated repeatedly that the right to use or  harvest forest resources incentivizes communities  to manage their forests sustainably (Seymour, La  Vina, and Hite 2014).  Supporting reforestation  Reforesting degraded or deforested land offers  substantial climate change mitigation benefits, and  could directly increase capabilities of communities  in the area. The benefits of reforestation have long  been acknowledged, but policy efforts have not  always been successful and communities have not  always had the right incentives to empower them to  undertake restoration.  An example of this emerges from Ethiopia.  Ethiopia’s forests once covered 30 percent of  the country’s land area but, by 2000, only 4 percent  remained forested (Forest Trends 2013).  In the 1980s, the Ethiopian government offered  communities food for planting trees, but this  approach proved ineffective partly because locals  viewed reforestation as a punishment rather  than an opportunity. When the government was  overthrown, deforestation accelerated as people  attempted to secure short-term economic gains  from cutting down trees (Jones 2010).  More recently, the Ethiopian government has  worked with nongovernmental organizations  (NGOs), corporations, and the United Nations to  protect and restore the country’s forests, while  enhancing the livelihoods of those who rely on  them. By empowering local agropastoralists to  secure their access and land rights, communities  were given a more powerful incentive to protect the  trees on their property (SOS Sahel 2008).  In addition to greater recognition of land-use  rights, successful projects have also involved opportunities  for local people to access resources—such  as seedlings or specialized knowledge—that can  generate long-term community benefits. Ethiopia’s  successful reforestation program included training  for raising cash crop trees (for example, Australian  eucalyptus, apple trees, and coffee trees), and using  a crop calendar to enable year-round harvests (Ministry  of Agriculture and Rural Development 2010;  Jones 2010).  Supporting local management  Community forestry is explicitly built on recognition  of the importance of local management and   decision-making for forest management. A remaining  challenge, however, has been the limited  resources of local communities to fully assume  management. In some situations, there may be  incomplete devolution of authority, while, in others,  communities may lack training or adequate  In Niger, policies that focused on farmers’ right to  manage trees on cropland have led to widescale  reforestation. Historically, communities in Niger held  customary rights to manage trees and forest resources.  However, under colonial legal regimes, national  policies and forest regulations placed trees under  government ownership (including trees in cultivated  fields). Government ownership of trees discouraged  communities from managing them sustainably.  Beginning in the 1980s, Niger started strengthening  community land and forest rights. Niger updated its Rural  Code to recognize community land rights and provided  training. Deforestation halted and reversed as farmers  protected or planted roughly 200 million trees on 5  million hectares of land (WRI 2008).  Niger’s policies have benefited farmers and bolstered  their capabilities. Farmers’ ability to steward their natural  resources and enhance their livelihoods has grown  significantly. According to one estimate, the policies  and programs undertaken in Niger have generated  about US$900 million in annual economic benefits  (Stevens et al. 2014). Community land rights policies  reduced greenhouse gas emissions as well. Farmers’  tree protection and planting has sequestered at least  30 million metric tons of carbon over the past 30 years    resources for long-term management (Charnley  and Poe 2007). As demonstrated in the case of  Guatemala’s community forest concessions (Box  22), communities have had to learn how to sustainably  manage timber and nontimber aspects of  the forests for commercial use, which has proven  difficult (Taylor 2010). Unequal access to training,  community resources, and existing power dynamics  can also contribute to uneven benefit sharing  within community forest systems. In Guatemala,  this challenge confronted some community concessions,  particularly those composed of new residents  from other parts of the country (Charnley and Poe  2007). Careful attention to the provision of training,  management capacity, and other resources is  an important part of successfully supporting community  forestry.  Key lessons for community forestry can also be  taken from Australia’s experience in supporting  Indigenous peoples in traditional management of  savanna land (Box 23). Encouraging traditional  management methods and empowering communities  through well-designed incentives can result in  emissions reductions, and provide an ongoing and  independent source of income that allows the community  to assume full management responsibility.  International Policy Strategies for  Supporting Low-Carbon Pathways  Numerous opportunities exist to pursue low-carbon  pathways while building capabilities. Many of these  opportunities are at the national or local levels, but  could be encouraged and supported through international  action. This section draws on examples  from the previous sections and recommends ways in  which the international community could support  these efforts. Because of overlaps among some of  Guatemala’s contribution to global greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions is relatively small, but the country has  established climate-change mitigation goals (Ministerio  de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2009). Conversion  of forest land to agricultural uses is a large source of  Guatemala’s GHG emissions, so the country aims to  improve management of its forest resources (ALM 2009;  Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2009;  Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2001).  The Maya Biosphere Reserve, which occupies roughly  60 percent of the Petén region in northern Guatemala  (Carr 2008), consists of three zones, which allow for  different levels of human activity to protect both the forest  and people’s livelihoods (Hughell and Butterfield 2008).  After extensive negotiations, the government granted communities rights to manage land in the reserve. The  primary product has been timber, though communities  have started harvesting nontimber resources and  exploring tourism. Communities have had to learn forest  management, sometimes struggling to do so, and the  distribution of benefits from community-based forestry  concessions has been somewhat controversial. Some  nonmembers claim that they have been partially excluded  from benefits, but current members counter that their  initial investments in managing their land justify their  benefits (Taylor 2010).  Even though community-based forestry has been  complicated by history, poverty, and competing interests,  it has contributed to conservation of Guatemala’s  forest resources and better livelihoods for the country’s  residents (Bray et al. 2008). The international community  helped Guatemala to set up the concessions for  community-based forestry and could continue to  help communities improve their forestry management  capabilities and diversify their economic activities.  BOX 22 | COMMUNITY FOREST  MANAGEMENT IN GUATEMALA’S  MAYA BIOSPHERE RESERVE  Australia’s indigenous peoples historically used small  fires to manage savanna land in the northern part of the  country. European settlers displaced the indigenous  peoples and discontinued their small burns. Over  time, this contributed to increasingly damaging and  uncontrollable wildfires, with as much as 69 percent of  large ranchlands burned in dry seasons. In 2010, an  indigenous corporation purchased land previously run  as a pastoral station, and reinstated the tradition of small  controlled burns. This change has limited wildfires to  less than 3 percent of the property. Along with providing  northern indigenous Australians a link to their cultural  heritage and historical homeland, this project qualified as  a national carbon-farming initiative. The sale of credits  from this initiative supports further management of the  property (Looker 2013).  BOX 23 | AUSTRALIA’S INDIGENOUS  PEOPLES MANAGE CONTROLLED BURNS  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up the five policy sectors described earlier, the recommendations  are grouped into four policy categories:  equitable low-carbon energy policy; equitably  shifting financial incentives; low-carbon transportation  planning; and equitable forestry policy. An  overarching category of recommendations focuses on  supporting vulnerability assessments across all mitigation  efforts. Several recommendations are crosscutting,  for instance, capacity building, and increases  in financial support are required in all cases.  Equitable Low-Carbon Energy Policy  The required energy transition will need to be  supported by a suite of specific policies, including  increasing electrification based on renewables, scaling  up renewables’ contribution to electricity grids,  and pursuing energy efficiency across all sectors.  ▪▪Bilateral and multilateral finance providers  should increase access to finance, credit or  other targeted approaches to encourage renewable  electrification and provide total energy  solutions to nontraditional banking populations  including women, the poor, and marginalized  communities. Such approaches could include  assistance to national lending agencies in the  form of building capacity for dealing with nontraditional  banking communities.  ▪▪There should be increased support from bilateral  and multilateral finance providers to scale up of  the use of renewables in countries with low access  to electricity and for strengthened efficiency  policies in countries with inefficient electricity  grids. These efforts should include support for  building the governance and policy enabling  environments required to regulate and maintain  renewable energy and efficiency programs.  ▪▪Bilateral and multilateral development agencies  and finance providers should provide guidance  and financial support to developing country governments  to enable equitable energy policies.  International organizations and finance providers  such as the Green Climate Fund, the World  Bank, and the UNFCCC should facilitate lesson  sharing among interested countries on feed-in  tariff design and implementation, reducing the  likelihood of unintended consequences for the  most vulnerable.  Equitably Shifting Financial Incentives  Shifting financial incentives to promote low-carbon  pathways is essential for reaching mitigation goals.  In addition, failing to shift incentives misses, or even  undermines, the opportunities at hand to enhance  the capabilities of people now and in the future. If  designed well, shifting incentive structures through  government policy could result in long-term benefits,  and provide revenues that can be used to meet the  needs of the most vulnerable and least well-off.  ▪▪Support should be provided by development  finance institutions so that all countries are able  to assess and publicly report their fossil-fuel  subsidies and set targets for phasing out fossil-fuel  subsidies. Phase-out should begin with reducing  or eliminating subsidies that benefit the  wealthiest individuals and communities and  with the aim of providing resources to build the  capabilities of the least well off, including their  health, education, and capacity to adapt to climate  impacts. A technical committee or subsidiary  body to the UNFCCC could work with the  IMF and others to develop guidance on how to  assess and quantify subsidies.  ▪▪Multilateral and bilateral funders should  provide the upfront finance needed to enable  equitable fossil-fuel subsidy reform and equitable  carbon-pricing policies. Such finance should  be especially targeted to reduce the immediate  impacts that confront poor populations.  ▪▪Funding and guidance should be provided for  the development of strategies to implement  fossil-fuel subsidy reform and carbon pricing in  ways that support the capabilities of those who  are least well off. International statements of  support for carbon pricing, or efforts to promote  international carbon markets, should also  include commitments to equitable pricing.  ▪▪Equitable low-carbon plans should be mainstreamed  into economic growth strategies  developed by both national and international  institutions.   ▪▪Capacity building and funding should be  provided to support the domestic data  collection and analysis that are required to  assess the effects of fossil-fuel subsidy reform  and carbon pricing on low-income and vulnerable  populations.  Supporting Equitable Low-Carbon Transportation  Affordable, low-carbon transportation is a central  plank in shifting toward a low-carbon economy.  Low-carbon transportation presents a significant  mitigation potential and offers a range of benefits  for equity and capabilities if well designed. These  benefits include improvements in health and safety,  mobility, access to employment, and financial savings.  As highlighted in previous sections, infrastructure  supporting low-carbon transportation requires  significant upfront financial investment.  ▪▪Public international financial support for lowcarbon  infrastructure projects should be prioritized  for projects that can demonstrate that low  income, vulnerable or otherwise marginalized  communities will benefit and not be negatively  affected by the projects.  ▪▪National and subnational programmatic policies  to support affordable low-carbon transportation  should be scaled up, and programmatic  plans that include strategies to ensure that  co-benefits are made available to vulnerable or  low-income communities should be prioritized.  ▪▪Support should be provided for impact assessments  for low-carbon transportation to identify  potential employment, displacements, or other  impacts on low-income, vulnerable or informal  populations. Support should also be provided to  monitor unintended consequences as transport  or building policies are implemented and once  they are fully operationalized.  ▪▪Wherever possible an integrated planning approach  should be used to assess and implement  low-carbon transportation planning to ensure  policies reinforce each other and do not lead to increased  challenges for those who are least well off.  Equitable Climate and Forestry Policy  Equitable forestry policy is a crucial part of international  and national climate efforts. Discussions of  equity already have contributed to the development  of REDD and REDD+, and there are important  safeguards being developed to help ensure that  local communities benefit from climate policy and  carbon offset arrangements. The nexus between  community land rights and forest protection is  an important area in which international institutions  can help countries to undertake policies  that enhance both climate action and capabilities.  Support by international institutions and finance  for efforts to strengthen community forest rights  should be a fundamental element in policies and  programs to reduce emissions from deforestation  and forest degradation.  ▪▪Funders and other international institutions  should facilitate policies and programs to  strengthen communities’ rights involving use  of forest resources, management of forests, and  access to the forest, and should support due  process for decisions about forests.  ▪▪International institutions like the Global  Environment Facility (GEF), and others with  REDD+ experience, should help countries to set  up concessions for community-based forestry  in areas where communities commit to sustainably  manage timber and other forest products.  Vulnerability Assessments for  All Low-Carbon Projects  It is important to acknowledge that all low-carbon  policies could have differential impacts on capabilities.  In order to ensure that the capabilities of those  who are potentially most vulnerable— including  women, indigenous peoples, youth, or other marginalized  communities—are protected or improved,  all projects should be subject to evaluation at the  planning stage and monitoring during and after  implementation. In addition, active stakeholder  engagement and participation is an important  strategy for ensuring that policies have beneficial  impacts on vulnerable populations. Both of these  policymaking elements require institutional capacity  and resources.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up ▪▪Capacity building and support should be provided  to ensure that “before and after” vulnerability  assessments and evaluations are carried  out, to identify impacts on the capabilities of all  affected groups.  ▪▪Support should be provided for participatory  planning and stakeholder engagement in the  development of mitigation policies across all  sectors. International organizations could also  engage in disseminating best practices for  policy design and public engagement.  To generate international  momentum and to  contribute to greater  wellbeing, especially  among those who are  most vulnerable or  least well off, climate  actions must also build  capabilities.    APPLYING THE  CAPABILITIES APPROACH  TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE,  ADAPTATION, AND LOSS  AND DAMAGE  Through examining case studies from 11 countries, this chapter  discusses the application of capabilities approach in understanding  the challenge in the design and implementation of national and local  adaptation policies and projects. This approach helps to understand  the different types and levels of vulnerability and the importance of  diverse and variable adaptation policies that can be designed through  the participatory planning process. The international community  can support these efforts through addressing the capacity needs  of the most vulnerable to engage in the policymaking process and  conducting research to inform long-term adaptation strategies.   As the impacts of climate change are increasingly  felt, prioritizing action on adaptation becomes  a pressing equity concern. If adequate action is  not taken, the people most vulnerable to climate  impacts and least able to adapt to them will face  loss of their livelihoods and reduced social and  economic opportunities.  At the same time, the fact that those hardest hit by  climate change are often the least responsible for  causing it raises significant equity issues. For some,  including many coastal communities and small  island developing states, the impacts may threaten  their very existence. Meanwhile, the current and  projected impacts have recently led to increasing  calls for comprehensive action to address issues of  loss and damage, those climate impacts to which  adaptation is difficult or impossible.  In international efforts to address adaptation and  resilience to climate change, much attention has  been appropriately placed on addressing the needs of  countries that are most vulnerable to climate change.  However, identifying and addressing the needs of  populations within countries, who are especially  vulnerable to climate impacts, is also an essential  task and is the focus of much of this chapter.  In this chapter, the report examines case studies,  drawn from 11 countries, both developing and  developed, highlighting the affect that vulnerability  can have on capabilities, and how well designed  policies targeting adaptation can build capabilities  and the resilience of countries.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up A Capabilities Approach to Adaptation  Requires Understanding, Participation,  and Innovation  Applying a capabilities lens to adaptation and resilience  (Box 24) serves as a reminder of the equity  dimensions present in adaptation. Different populations  are affected by climate change in varying  ways and to differing degrees, often due to disparities  in social and economic contexts and people’s  underlying capabilities. Moreover, climate policies  themselves may not be designed in ways that take  into account these diverse levels of capabilities.  Just as with low-carbon development, a capabilities  approach in the adaptation arena helps to identify  policies that will enhance equity and build capabilities,  as well as avoid unintended negative consequences,  particularly for the least well off.  In this chapter we apply the capabilities approach  as a lens to understand the challenges in the design  and implementation of adaptation policies and  projects. This lens:  ▪▪Highlights the importance of understanding  differing types and levels of vulnerability, and  incorporating that understanding into the design  of adaptation policies;  ▪▪Shows that adaptation policies must be highly  diverse and variable and based on inclusive  and participatory planning processes that meet  specific populations’ needs;  ▪▪Supports the ability of the most vulnerable and  least well off to pursue innovation in the design  and implementation of adaptation policies and  projects.  Each of these elements is examined using case  studies from developed and developing countries,  illustrating how an application of the capabilities  approach supports the achievement of equity.  This chapter also highlights the importance  of national adaptation planning that provides  for a focus on the most vulnerable populations  and ensures that capabilities are protected and  strengthened through robust participatory plans  based on inclusive participation.  The analysis in this chapter ultimately supports the  conclusion that, despite the highly context-specific  nature of adaptation, important lessons can be  drawn from diverse experiences that can inform  both national and international action and ultimately  build capabilities and achieve equity.  Adaptation is defined as an adjustment in natural or  human systems in response to actual or expected  climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or  exploits beneficial opportunities (IPCC 2007). Adaptive  capacity has emerged as an important concept used to  refer to the ability that individuals or communities have  to adapt to the effects of climate change. Those with the  greatest capabilities are most likely to have a range of  resources and options available to take action, which can  contribute to their adaptive capacity (WRI et al. 2011) .  Vulnerability can be understood as a combination of  individual or community sensitivity to a climate or  nonclimate shock and their capacity to adapt to it. To  reduce vulnerability to climate change, we must focus  on building capabilities and adaptive capacity. Similarly,  the reduction of capabilities through climate impacts or  inequitable climate policies could increase vulnerability.  Resilience is the ability of a community to resist, absorb,  and recover from the effects of hazards in a timely and  efficient manner, preserving or restoring its essential  basic structures, functions, and identity (UNISDR 2009).  Stemming from analyses of ecosystems (Holling 1973)  and applied in disaster management (World Bank and  GFDRR 2013), resilience has been used to describe the  characteristics that enable communities to deal with large  shocks— both climate and nonclimate related—without  suffering significant losses or being fundamentally altered.  Loss and damage have usually been viewed as the entire  range of damage and permanent loss associated with  climate impacts that can no longer be avoided through  mitigation and for which adaptation is difficult or no  longer possible. Increasingly, the relationship between  mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage is being seen  as more complex, highlighting the role that each plays in  influencing the other. The loss and damage attributable to  climate change is expected to increase over time due to  increases in frequency and magnitude of extreme weather  events, as well as impacts of slow-onset events.  BOX 24 | ADAPTATION, VULNERABILITY,  RESILIENCE, AND LOSS AND DAMAGE   Capabilities Reduce Vulnerability  Multiple and overlapping factors shape each person’s  capabilities and, as a result, influence their  vulnerability to climate impacts. Gender, economic  resources, physical ability, age, and ethnicity are just  some of the factors that combine to make it more  or less difficult for individual people to build their  capabilities. Some of these factors may be equally  experienced by all members in a specific community  or locality, but some of them will not. For instance,  gender norms about access to education or to financial  resources such as credit will shape the capabilities  of men and women differently.  Individuals or communities with a broader range of  capabilities may have reduced vulnerability because  they have access to more resources or abilities  to deal with potential climate impacts. Effective  adaptation policies must be sensitive to and address  these differences in vulnerability and capabilities,  including by avoiding approaches that exacerbate  existing vulnerabilities. Policies and projects  that are designed to respond to the differentiated  nature of capabilities and vulnerabilities, and that  also deliberately aim to build capabilities, can be  highly effective in building adaptive capacity and  enhancing equity for those who are most vulnerable.  Adaptation processes in line with development  strategies that reduce vulnerabilities and increase  people’s adaptive capacity in a broad sense would  bring immediate benefits as well as strengthen  people’s ability to deal with future threats (Burton  et al. 2002; Huq et al. 2003; Adger et al. 2007).  Responses to climate impacts in coastal Bangladesh  demonstrate the ways in which physical climate  impacts can intersect with different levels of capabilities,  and without well-designed policy interventions,  exacerbate existing inequalities (Box 25).  The importance of considering differing types and  levels of vulnerability is especially stark in efforts  to build resilience in the agriculture sector, particularly  in poorer rural communities. Agriculture  is central to many people’s livelihoods, particularly  in developing countries, where it constitutes  approximately 29 percent of GDP and employs 65  percent of the population (Campbell et al. 2011).  A combination of factors, including sea level rise and  the consequent salt-water intrusion, combined with an  absence of any effective government water management  programs and an attractive market for shrimp, prompted  an increase in shrimp farming and other types of  aquaculture by larger landowners, replacing the rice and  vegetable farms along the coast.  This shift—a form of adaptation that maintained or  enhanced their capabilities—was facilitated by large  landowners’ greater adaptive capacity, in this case  access to land and finance. However, this option was not  available to poorer households, and their capabilities  have been diminished as salinization increased and  land became unsuitable for farming or other uses.  Poorer villagers also face decreasing access to natural  resources that, in the past, provided the rural population  with materials for fuel, fodder, building, and food. Unlike  wealthier community members, they may not have  other means—such as access to finance—to get these  necessities (Pouliotte, Smit, and Westerhoff 2009).  BOX 25 | SHRIMP FARMING IN  SOUTHEAST BANGLADESH  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up The connection between nutrition and livelihoods  is particularly close for the rural poor, many of  whom depend on subsistence agriculture (Campbell  et al. 2011). As a source of food and livelihood,  agriculture supports many other capabilities, such  as access to education and shelter. However, there  are substantial variations in the vulnerability and  capabilities of communities facing potential climate  impacts to agriculture. For instance, as shown in  the case of Uganda (Box 26), disparities in access  to credit and education shape the options farmers  have when addressing climate risks.  Identifying the most vulnerable populations or  communities, particularly by looking at the intersection  of physical climate impacts and social vulnerability,  is among the most important challenges  in developing adaptation policies and climate  risk management systems. Studies identifying  climate hazards and social vulnerability are typically  conducted separately, but these approaches  can be integrated. For example, a study of coastal  areas in the United States (Box 27) examined both  the potential impact of natural hazards and the  populations most likely to be negatively affected  because of their social and economic characteristics  (Oxfam 2009). Understanding vulnerability has  significant potential for improving planning and   decision-making, particularly in order to design policies  that actively build the capabilities of vulnerable  Most Ugandans have only short-term adaptation  strategies that will be ineffective at dealing with longterm  changes to the climate (Caffrey et al. 2013; Berman,  Quinn, and Paavola 2014; Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza  2011). To survive shocks, households employ the  following strategies: drawing down savings, borrowing  money, reducing consumption (sometimes withdrawing  children from education), selling assets (such as  livestock), increasing labor (sometimes with children),  and migrating (Berman, Quinn, and Paavola 2014; Hisali,  Birungi, and Buyinza 2011).  Most of these strategies have the disadvantage that  they offer only short-term relief. Moreover, relatively  disadvantaged households in Uganda can find it difficult,  or even impossible, to use them. Education, wealth, age,  gender, access to markets, access to credit, and land  tenure all affect households’ access to certain adaptation  strategies. For example, households with higher  education levels are better able to diversify their income  sources. Access to credit allows households to avoid  drawing down savings (Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza  2011; Caffrey et al. 2013; Berman, Quinn, and Paavola  2014). Because of prevailing gender roles, women have  relatively fewer employment opportunities, less time  to seek employment, and might have fewer employable  skills (Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza 2011).  Uganda can improve its resilience to climate change by  increasing farmers’ access to credit, increasing labor  productivity in agriculture (through investment in research  and agricultural extension), improving access to markets,  developing new crop varieties, increasing farmer groups’  capacity to work with each other and national initiatives,  and investing in other sectors such as public health and  education (Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza 2011; Caffrey et  al. 2013; Berman, Quinn, and Paavola 2014).  BOX 26 | ADAPTATION CHALLENGES FOR  FARMERS IN UGANDA  The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) was developed  by the University of South Carolina and applied with  Oxfam America to climate-change-related hazards. The  SoVI statistically examines the underlying social and  demographic characteristics of various populations and  how they intersect with climate-change-related hazards.  The study used a series of maps that overlay climate-change-  related hazards with social vulnerability. The maps  identified hotspots in the southeastern United States at  significant risk in the face of four climate-change-related  hazards: drought, flooding, hurricane force winds, and sea  level rise.  To determine social vulnerability, the SoVI uses variables to define the multiple dimensions of social  vulnerability; eight components account for most of the  variation in social vulnerability in the study: wealth, age,  race, gender, ethnicity, rural farm populations, special  needs populations, and employment status. Roughly percent of all U.S. counties that experience persistent  poverty (defined as a county in which at least 20 percent  of the population experiences poverty for three decades or  more) lie within this region (Oxfam 2009).  From these data, it was possible to determine not only  where social vulnerability is concentrated in the region but  also which areas are most vulnerable to which climate-change-  related hazards.  BOX 27 | SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX  IN THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES   communities. It provides a critical first step toward  developing informed hazard-reduction strategies  and improving resilience of the most vulnerable.  Recognition of the differences in vulnerabilities and  capabilities in the face of climate shocks, such as  extreme weather events, can be incorporated into  adaptation planning. A key example emerges from  Bangladesh’s continued efforts to build greater  resilience in the face of tropical storms, cyclones, and  flooding (Box 28). A key part of this effort has been  the development of comprehensive disaster management  programs that have incorporated recognition of  the differentiation of populations in storm-sensitive  areas. For instance, such efforts have included  recognition of gender differentiation in terms of  vulnerability to nonclimate risks, such as gendered  harassment or social norms that prohibit girls from  learning to swim, and the intersection of these with  extreme weather events (WRI et al. 2011).  Adaptation Projects Need Participatory Design  Designing effective and long-term adaptation  responses requires understanding the pathways  that people are currently pursuing toward greater  well-being, and ensuring that interventions are  aligned and ultimately support these goals. A  capabilities approach enables policymakers to do  this, as well as to identify the specific opportunities  and barriers that make their ability to achieve wellbeing  more or less successful. From this perspective,  a capabilities approach draws attention to local  contexts, suggesting that each adaptation project or  need must be designed with inclusive participation  by those affected by climate impacts, particularly  the most vulnerable.  This is illustrated by two cases in Vietnam, both  involving adaptive attempts to protect coastlines  through mangrove restoration (Box 29). Unanticipated  side effects were experienced in the northern  project, because of a failure to incorporate the  priorities of the communities they intended to  protect (Bruun and Casse 2013). By contrast, in  the southern project, the recognition of inclusive  processes to design and implement mangrove restoration  ultimately resulted in the achievement of not  only increased adaptive capacity but also long-term  social and economic opportunities for all members  of the community.  The population of Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to  natural disasters, especially those occurring near coasts,  because two thirds of the population live at or below an  elevation of five meters (Bangladesh 2009). Given the  country’s vulnerability, the Government of Bangladesh  has developed a Comprehensive Disaster Management  Programme (CDMP) and a National Plan for Disaster  to respond to disasters and protect the most vulnerable  members of its society.  Women are exposed to additional risks that are not  experienced by men, before, during and after natural  disasters. Women, for example, are discouraged from  learning to swim. They are less likely to have access to the  knowledge networks available to men about impending  floods or storm surges (Reid 2014). They face sexual  abuse in shelters that are set up after natural disasters.  If disasters damage sanitation and drinking water  infrastructure, women face harassment and attacks when  they seek privacy to relieve themselves and when they  travel great distances for safe drinking water (Department  of Women’s Affairs 2012). Girls are also less likely than  boys to pursue primary education after disasters (UNISDR  2011; Department of Women’s Affairs 2012).  Recognizing this level of vulnerability, Bangladesh  addresses some of these issues in its disaster planning.  In the first phase of the CDMP (2004–09), Bangladesh  created the Disaster Management Information Centre;  mapped hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities; and trained  public officials (WRI et al. 2011). In the second phase  (2010–14), Bangladesh identified linkages among  stakeholders, levels of government, approaches to  disaster-risk reduction, and approaches to climate-change  adaptation. One of these linkages was the Department  of Women’s Affairs in the Ministry of Women and  Children, which was involved in developing nationwide  Disaster Risk Reduction strategies and, with support  from the CDMP, is working to find culturally appropriate  solutions. National disaster planners are incorporating  gender concerns into overall planning, and the Ministry  of Women and Children is mainstreaming these strategies  into its regular projects through a number of initiatives  that range from the high level (creating networks with  disaster risk experts) to the practical (teaching staff and  partners how to swim).  BOX 28 | BANGLADESH’S  COMPREHENSIVE DISASTER  MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up In both cases, the national government, local governments,  and international NGOs implemented  the restoration projects (WRI et al. 2011; Osbeck  et al. 2010). While healthy mangroves can be a  solution to both climate- and nonclimate-related  problems, they take time to grow, and cannot be  used immediately for aquaculture or seafood collection  until the forests are somewhat mature (Osbeck  et al. 2010). The involved parties needed to remain  engaged over a long time before the majority of the  benefits of the projects were realized.  Both the Vietnam cases highlight the importance of  building adaptation planning around local contexts  and inclusive participation. In the Vietnamese cases  the ability to engage and benefit all community members—  including the poorest—was crucial to success.  By not fully understanding the local reality that poorer  families had to have access to marine resources in  mangroves, the northern adaptation scheme actually  resulted in a loss of capabilities for some.  Slow-onset impacts of climate change, like sea  level rise, threaten to break down individual and  community capabilities over time. Attempts to  address slow-onset events must not ignore the  more immediate needs of communities, lest the  intended beneficiaries lose capabilities through  adaptation interventions. Such losses are important  to acknowledge on their own, but also can fuel local  opposition to adaptation attempts.  Vietnam has an extensive coastline,  more than 3,000 kilometers long,  with two important river deltas that  contain most of the country’s arable  land (Bruun and Casse 2013). The  country is therefore very susceptible  to sea level rise, storm surges, and  saltwater intrusion. One way Vietnam  is protecting its coastline and crops is  through mangrove forest restoration.  Mangrove forests buffer coastlines and  coastal communities against severe  weather and storm surges (IFRC 2014);  they also sequester carbon and provide  a rich habitat for biodiversity. War and  economic development projects (for  example, for aquaculture) have led to  the loss of 80 percent of the country’s  original mangrove forests since the  1950s (Tai et al. 2009).  Different policy approaches to  mangrove restoration were taken in  different parts of the country. In the  north, mangrove-planting projects  were given protected status, which  prevented local communities from  using those portions of coastline  for shrimp harvesting and other  seafood collection. Local communities  were hired to plant and protect the  mangroves but, once funding ended,  the local people stopped protecting the  mangroves, in part because they were  opposed to the monoculture approach  of the restoration (WRI et al. 2011;  Osbeck et al. 2010).  In the south, however, efforts were  made to incorporate the poverty  alleviation concerns of local  communities alongside coastline  protection. This inclusive approach  was especially successful in places  where mangrove restoration was  coupled with social services and  infrastructure projects, and where the  legal classification of the forests did not  prohibit local communities from using  the areas sustainably (WRI et al. 2011;  Osbeck et al. 2010). At least 8,960  hectares have been replanted since  1994 (IFRC 2014, 4), and sea dikes and  private property have been significantly  better protected following mangrove  restoration (IFRC 2014, 5–6).  In the northern projects, the relatively  wealthy benefited most from the  mangrove restoration because the  projects increased their political and  managerial power. The poorest people  were most dependent on the mangroves,  but lost access to the rich marine life  attracted to the mangrove forests, which  represented an important supplement to  their diets (Hue 2005). As a result they  actually lost capabilities through the  attempted adaptation project.  Both approaches, in the north and the  south, also had very different effects  on the livelihoods of men and women.  Shrimp farmers are more likely to  be men, so protecting the mangrove  forests from commercial farming  reduced men’s ability to practice  aquaculture for commercial gain.  Women, conversely, are more likely  to collect seafood such as clams and  oysters that thrive in mangrove forests  to provide for their families or to sell.  In protected mangroves, they were  not always permitted to collect those  species, so an important source of  calories or household income was no  longer available (Osbeck et al. 2010).  These patterns serve as an illustration  of the importance of taking differential  vulnerabilities and capabilities in  specific locations into account when  designing adaption policies.  BOX 29 | VIETNAM’S MANGROVE RESTORATION   Adaptation efforts that focus on the provision of  knowledge and capacity building to the communities  themselves are likely to be more successful in  building resilience across both social and economic  contexts. An example of this is an online planning  tool developed in Australia to assist coastal communities  determine their climate change vulnerability  and put in place long-term, locally appropriate  plans for the future (Box 30). Local communities  with increased capacity are empowered to make  informed decisions about how to adapt to locally  specific climate change threats.  Applying the capabilities approach to climate  change strongly emphasizes the need to ensure that  vulnerable populations are included in research on  climate impacts and adaptation responses. Men  and women play different roles in society and can  bring different sets of resources, capacities, and  knowledge, as well as different needs and requirements,  to initiatives for climate change adaptation.  Furthermore, there is increasing recognition of  the value of indigenous knowledge in improving  observations of climate change and its impacts,  and for the assessment of impacts, vulnerability,  and adaptation, particularly in vulnerability assessments  (UNFCCC 2013a).  The Arctic Council’s Arctic Climate Impact Assessment  (ACIA 2005) is an example of a successful  approach to combining indigenous traditional knowledge  with western science that resulted in the incorporation  of a broad set of observations from indigenous  peoples with a regional assessment of the impacts of  climate change in the Arctic. Indigenous traditional  knowledge was incorporated into all aspects of the  assessment and highlighted in the resulting report.  Such extensive collaboration led to a more robust  knowledge base on the impacts of climate change on  the Arctic (UNFCCC 2013a). Indigenous and scientific  knowledge strengthened each other; for example,  indigenous knowledge was able to help explain how  caribou migrations may be triggered by seasonal cues,  such as day length, air temperature, or ice thickness,  strengthening the assessments of biologists (Thorpe  et al. 2001; as quoted in ACIA 2005). In cases where  indigenous and scientific observations conflicted, new  research opportunities were identified for assessing  environmental change, deepening insights into  the nature and impacts of environmental change  (UNFCCC 2013a).  In Uganda, a project was proposed under the  country’s national adaptation program of action to  include indigenous knowledge in development of  the program (Box 31).  Although coastal communities in Australia were aware  of the changing climate and the likely local impacts of  sea level rise and increased extreme weather events,  there was a limited awareness of how they would affect  the local commercial and recreational fishing, marine  tourism, and aquaculture.  In response, an online planning tool was developed by  Murdoch University, the University of Tasmania, and  the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research  Organisation (CSIRO).  The tool was based on three case studies that included  different geographical features and populations to draw  out key lessons on how each coastal town dealt with  the effects of climate change in the marine environment  (Coastal Climate Blueprint 2014).  Based on the information gathered from these case  studies and the framework for vulnerability established  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  coastal communities across Australia are now able to  determine their community’s vulnerability to the effects  of climate change in the marine environment. Based on  a questionnaire identifying exposure to climate change  risks and the community’s natural, human, social,  financial, and physical capital that may be useful in  avoiding or mitigating those risks, an overall score is  provided representing the vulnerability of a particular  community (Coastal Climate Blueprint 2014) .  This relatively simple tool enables communities that  may have little to no expertise in climate science and  vulnerability risk assessments, to understand their strengths  and weaknesses in the face of marine climate change and  prepare for future changes in climate and sea life.  BOX 30 | INCREASING AWARENESS  OF COASTAL IMPACTS IN AUSTRALIAN  COASTAL COMMUNITIES  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Capabilities Foster Innovation Needed to Adapt  A capabilities approach emphasizes that people  can, and do, make decisions and seek strategies  that improve their overall well-being. Applying this  principle to the concept of adaptation and resilience  requires policies and projects to support innovation.  Through innovation, people are more likely to  find solutions that are both efficient and effective  and locally relevant. Such bottom-up approaches  will provide more lasting adaptive responses than  will comparable top-down approaches.  This concept is rooted in a broader theme seen  throughout this report—that the ability of the  individual to innovate is underpinned by larger  systems. Access to new ideas and new technologies  and financial resources varies widely but is essential  for innovation (Rogers 2003). From an equity  perspective, it is critical to ensure that particularly  vulnerable people have the resources they need  to innovate, and sufficient basic social safety to  allow them to attempt something new. This often  requires improved access to finance for traditionally  nonbanking populations, and specialized capacity  building and support for women and youth.  Innovation in agriculture  Innovation is particularly important in agriculture.  Adequate food is a basic human need; in the coming  decades, agricultural production will have to rise to  meet the demand of increasing populations, compounded  by the growing popularity of meat-intensive  diets (Campbell et al. 2011; Godfray et al. 2010;  Anwar et al. 2013). Adaptation policies must promote  innovation by farmers in new techniques, planting  times, and seed varieties. Of critical importance is that  all farmers and landholders have the opportunity to  innovate and do not face financial barriers. Unless  climate adaptation policies specifically aim to be  inclusive, well-off farmers are more likely to benefit,  while others remain vulnerable. Farmers’ wealth and  farm size affect their ability to experiment with new  practices because wealthier farmers can more easily  set aside a portion of their plots to try out new  methods (Tambo and Abdoulaye 2012).  For example, in Tanzania, smallholders with capital,  including assets such as livestock, and direct access  to extension service information, were more likely to  experiment with drought-resistant maize varieties  than were farmers without these resources (Westengen  and Brysting 2014). Government intervention  can assist in the process, providing seed finance  to entrepreneurs and therefore encouraging other  institutions to follow. In Zimbabwe, the United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) helped  kick start seed multiplication businesses promoting  climate-change-resilient seeds (UNDP 2014d).  According to a report by International Development  Research Centre, “seed funding might lead to debt  finance, including from local commercial banks”  (Tippmann et al. 2013). Supporting innovation  in this way ensures that sources of livelihoods are  climate-change resilient from the start, more efficiently  combining climate and development objectives.  These examples illustrate the role of locally  driven innovation and the importance of directing  global innovation toward the need of vulnerable  populations. Although it was farmers themselves  who experimented and developed new agricultural  systems, the drought-resistant seeds and additional  extension service information stems from broader  social investments in research and development.  Innovation is essential, but access to the tools of innovation  may be linked to the same factors that drive  differentiated vulnerability and capabilities broadly.  One of the projects proposed by Uganda in its national  adaptation program of action (NAPA) was the indigenous  knowledge and natural resources management project.  The project was designed to deepen the understanding  of indigenous knowledge and its potential use for  strengthening adaptation. In particular, the NAPA  highlighted that a “lack of frameworks…coupled with total  disregard of indigenous knowledge due to misconception  and disrespect of cultural values” had resulted in a lack  of research in the area (Uganda 2007). During the NAPA  consultation process, indigenous practices were discussed,  including the use of water harvesting and seeds to purify  water in times of water scarcity and the need to understand  traditional food preservation techniques to increase food  security (UNFCCC 2013a).  BOX 31 | UGANDA’S USE OF INDIGENOUS  TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN ITS  NATIONAL ADAPTATION PROGRAMME  OF ACTION   For instance, access to key resources for agricultural  innovation, such as land and credit, are highly  gender-related in many countries (Demetriades and  Esplen 2009; Ashby et al. 2012). Access to information  can also be unequal. Gender-bias in government  institutions may restrict women’s access to agricultural  extension services, which improve agricultural  productivity in general, as well as in the face of climate  change in particular (Swarup et al. 2011). Women  are also likely to be engaged in many other activities,  including child and elder care responsibilities, and  thus may have fewer chances to build savings to withstand  climate-change-related financial shocks (Demetriades  and Esplen 2009). Climate change adaptation  and mitigation interventions that are sensitive to  gender tend to perform better (Ashby et al. 2012), as  the case study of China demonstrates (Box 32).  A capabilities approach to examining innovation in  the adaptation context highlights the importance  of broader systems in supporting those capabilities  that enable individuals to innovate and adapt.  Strategies to support adaptation and resilience  must therefore prioritize funding pilot studies and  providing access to credit for early adopters.  Similarly, some innovations extend beyond the  scale of the individual and stem from the cooperation  of larger entities such as NGOs, governments,  or the private sector. The development of a “system  of rice intensification” is an example of an  attempt to harness the innovation of these players  and direct it toward efforts to build capabilities of  communities by improving labor efficiency, adding  to soil health, and increasing yields (Box 33).  Importantly, this process recognizes that providing  technological improvements alone is not enough:  capacity building and appropriate local engagement  is essential. Adaptation must be designed to  respond to the diversity of actual needs, desires,  and ongoing efforts of communities trying to protect  and improve their well-being.  China has pursued government-led  projects to improve farmers’ climate  resilience. Roughly one third of China’s  agricultural land is in the Huanghe,  Huaihe, and Haihe River Plain (3H  Plain), which produces half of China’s  grain (Dan et al. 2012; Wang and Li  2010). However, the 3H Plain lacks  water resources (Dan et al. 2012).  In 2004, China initiated a regional  project with the objective of improving  agricultural production by addressing  water scarcity in the 3H Plain. The  project had a budget of US$463  million, financed by the World Bank,  and the organizing agency was the  Ministry of Finance’s State Office  of Comprehensive Agricultural  Development (CAD). In 2006, the  program introduced measures  specifically aimed at adapting  to climate change (for example,  introducing drought- and pest-resistant  crop varieties) using a US$5  million investment from the Global  Environment Facility (WRI et al. 2011).  Farmers were initially reluctant to  adopt new crop varieties, but they were  persuaded after they experienced higher  yields. Project organizers helped create  water-user groups, which enabled  them to disseminate information about  water-efficient practices. Irrigation  infrastructure was improved, which  made more water available for crop  production. Water-user groups took  over the operation and maintenance  of facilities constructed during the  project. The project benefits could  then be sustained after the project  formally ended because affected  citizens were engaged in its success.  Women received particular attention.  For example, a gender trust fund was  created to finance training programs  specifically for women (WRI et al. 2011;  Wang and Li 2010).  China’s program improved agricultural  production in the 3H Plain and  simultaneously made agricultural  production more resilient to climate  change (Wang and Li 2010). An extreme  drought struck part of the 3H Plain in  early 2009, but farmers weathered it well  because of the improved irrigation, better  water management practices, and drought-resistant  crop varieties (WRI et al. 2011).  The project’s success was, at least  in part, the result of the integrated  approach adopted by CAD, its  collaboration with scientists, and  incorporation of farmers’ views. CAD  coordinated activities among Chinese  government agencies in different  sectors and at different levels of  government. This integrated approach  helped bring people with relevant  expertise and authority into the project  to achieve its goals. The organizers also  worked with scientists to evaluate initial  efforts and demonstration projects and  then incorporate results from those  evaluations into future project work.  Finally, famers’ views were elicited  through a survey to shape project  activities in accordance with their needs  and attitudes (Wang and Li 2010).  BOX 32 | CHINA’S APPROACH TO FARMING IN A DRY REGION  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Innovations in health care  The impacts of climate change on health will  depend on many factors, many of which are directly  related to capabilities, such as the effectiveness of  a community’s public health and safety systems to  address or prepare for the risk and the behavior,  age, gender, and economic status of individuals  affected. Current estimates indicate that the  impacts could extend to approximately 250,000  additional deaths per year between 2030 and  2050 as a result of heat exposure in elderly people  (38,000), diarrhea (48,000), malaria (60,000), and  childhood undernutrition (95,000) (WHO 2014).  Applying a capabilities approach highlights the role  that innovation could play in both the prevention  of these impacts and continued efforts to develop  better strategies for dealing with neglected tropical  diseases as well as the development of broad social  systems such as early warning systems for events  such as heat waves or malarial outbreaks. This has  been seen in Botswana, through the creation of  effective early warning systems, developed from  methods historically used in agriculture, that have  led to decreased vulnerability and improved human  well-being (Box 34).  A System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is an  agroecological approach that focuses on better  husbandry of rice crops. The concept is that changes  in how rice is planted by hand will result in higher  yields, require fewer inputs such as seeds, and lower  methane gas emissions from paddies. Such an approach  addresses food shortage issues, increases opportunities  for small-scale farmers to become involved, increases  profitability, and reduces emissions (Oxfam 2014; Global  Commission on the Economy and Climate 2014).  Oxfam started working on SRI in 2000 and has since  expanded its programs to 12 countries in Asia, West  Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean (Oxfam  2014). As of 2013, over 1.5 million smallholder farmers  in groups supported by Oxfam’s partners in Cambodia,  Sri Lanka, and Vietnam had benefited from SRI, using  both local and improved varieties of rice (Oxfam 2014).  Widespread adoption of SRI has led to increases in  yields in addition to improved soil ecosystems after  each season of SRI practice, ultimately improving the  capability of farmers to achieve social and economic  well-being (Global Commission on the Economy and  Climate 2014).  The same husbandry principles are applied to new crop  rotations, such as potatoes in Vietnam. Rice straw and  stubble are used as a mulch bed, which, as it gradually  decomposes, improves the soil structure for the next rice  crop. Farmers have saved between 28 and 47 percent in  terms of labor, while gaining improvements of between 8  and 25 percent in yields and earning additional income  of $480–950 per hectare (Oxfam 2014). They are also  increasingly adopting complementary technologies such  as handheld rotary weeders, which not only improve  efficiency but also address concerns over women’s labor.  Successful scaling up of these innovations requires an  enabling policy environment, particularly in terms of  building human capital and empowering communities.  SRI is currently being practiced in over 50 countries and  is promoted by organizations such as the International  Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Deutsche  Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the  Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Food and Agriculture  Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World  Bank (Oxfam 2014).  BOX 33 | SYSTEM OF RICE  INTENSIFICATION   Using Capabilities to Strengthen  National Adaptation Planning  Adaptation planning is an issue of extreme importance  to those who are least well off or most vulnerable  to climate change. The capabilities of future  generations in vulnerable areas are likely to depend  on robust and forward-looking adaptation planning.  To ensure integration across portfolios and  alignment with funding mechanisms and regulatory  regimes—such planning should be focused at  the national level. However, many vulnerable and  marginalized communities—which include future  generations—have limited or no capacity to engage  in policymaking, particularly at the national and  regional levels, thus they may be overlooked if their  needs are not explicitly included in planning.  The design of national planning processes for climate  change adaptation must include strong mechanisms  for public engagement to protect the most vulnerable  segments of societies and help build their capabilities.  Marginalized groups and the least well off must  be represented in policymaking (Foti and de Silva  Botswana reduced its number of malaria cases by percent between 2008 and 2012, from 17,886 cases in  2008 to 311 cases in 2012, and reduced the deaths from  malaria from 12 in 2008 to just three in 2012 through an  innovative program that adapted a weather early warning  system (Simon et al. 2013).  Malaria is caused by parasites that are transmitted to  people through the bites of infected mosquitos. The disease  is preventable and curable, but still kills approximately  627,000 people every year, the majority being children  under five in Africa (WHO 2013). The distribution of malaria  is strongly affected by climate and its transmission tends to  occur in warm, humid areas where water can collect (WHO  2009). Advances in prevention and control measures have  significantly reduced the malaria burden in many places,  but some experts fear that climate change might impede  that progress as changing temperatures and rainfall patterns  expand the ranges of infected mosquitos, spreading the  disease to additional parts of the world ( Smith et al. 2014).  In Botswana, the outbreak of malaria is seasonal and  tends to follow rainy periods. Using climate-forecasting  data, previously used only in the agricultural sector,  Botswana’s National Malaria Control Programme can  now map probability distributions of the risk of malaria.  Predictions of malaria incidence can be made up to four  months in advance (Thomson et al. 2006). This advance  warning can give governments and healthcare institutions  increased time to prepare and take preventative measures  such as spraying insecticides, distributing bed nets, and  distributing antimalarial drugs.  Understanding one of the risks most pertinent for  well-being in the face of climate change impacts, and  identifying the opportunity to innovate with existing data  and methodologies, enabled Botswana to develop an  early warning system which is more efficient, effective,  and locally applicable. It has allowed for more targeted  interventions and, in conjunction with improved  prevention measures, helped the country significantly  reduce its malaria burden.  BOX 34 | ADVANCE WARNING SYSTEMS  FOR MALARIA IN BOTSWANA  A national adaptation plan (NAP) is a process by which  a country can develop and implement a long-term plan  for national adaptation in a way that is fully integrated  with broader development plans and sectoral strategies  and institutions. The UNFCCC has produced technical  guidelines to help countries develop their plans, but the  process for developing NAPs is highly flexible and can  be designed for specific country contexts.  By contrast, a national adaptation program of  action (NAPA) is a process for least developed  countries to identify priority activities that respond to  their urgent and immediate needs to adapt to climate  change—those for which further delay would increase  vulnerability and/or costs at a later stage.  Together, both processes enable Parties to the Convention  to plan for both short- and long-term effects of climate  change in a way that is both action-oriented and country-driven.  Both NAPs and NAPAs are determined according  to national circumstances.  BOX 35 | WHAT ARE NAPS AND NAPAS?  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 2010). To participate in environmental decisions,  poor and marginalized people need access to information  and  decision-making. Barriers to their access  to policymaking and appropriate ways to insure their  inclusion are presented in Table 5.  The UNFCCC has developed two mechanisms to  help Parties to the Convention plan for both short- and  long-term effects of climate change: national  adaptation plans (NAPs) and national adaptation  programs of action (NAPAs) (Box 35). To ensure  that adaptation planning processes, including the  development of NAPs and NAPAs, protect vulnerable  segments of the population, governments  should first identify the groups who are likely to be  impacted by a given problem or policy and ensure  that their perspectives and input are included in the  planning process (Box 36). Applying a capabilities  approach emphasizes the importance of allowing  individuals to determine which capabilities are  essential to their well-being and taking a proactive  role in the planning process. Robust arguments can  be made for the effectiveness of such an approach,  Table 5 | Barriers to Access to Policymaking for the Poor and Policy Responses  BARRIER POLICY RESPONSE  Lack of legal criteria for enhanced engagement Identify the poor and establish criteria to ensure enhanced access  Literacy: Basic reading skills; ability to understand technical  content; language  Use the appropriate form: ensure that information around decisions and  opportunities to influence decisions for the environment matches the  technical understanding, literacy levels, and native languages of the poor  Access to communication channels: Poor physical access to  information technology such as internet, papers, television,  radio, texting  Use the appropriate channels: ensure that information relevant to decisions  and opportunities to influence decisions about the environment are  communicated through channels used by the poor  Cost: Official fees; travel; foregone work; time constraints;  cost of childcare; corruption  Reduce costs: remove barriers, reduce official fees, and provide subsidies  for participation  Exposure to risk from participating: Personal risk (physical  or psychological intimidation); property risk (threat of  expropriation, burglary, etc.)  Defend the individuals and organizations that promote access  Official documentation: Lack of legal identity; burden of proof Remove legal barriers of standing and evidence  Cultural context: Expectations about who has a “voice”;  meaningfulness of participation  Build capacity and raise awareness, make the voice of the poor influential  Source: Foti and de Silva (2010, 16).   based on the principle that people are more likely  to participate if they believe that their input will  be influential (Foti and de Silva 2010). The earlier  public engagement starts, the more likely it is to  influence the outcome of a given policy planning  process (WRI et al. 2011).  A central tenet of the capabilities approach is the recognition  that every human being is best able to decide  for him or herself what it means to have achieved a  state of well-being. Applying this philosophy to planning  strongly supports public participation, bottomup  governance and a broad institutional/programmatic  approach, as opposed to narrowly targeted,  top-down adaptation mechanisms.  Locally designed and compiled adaptation plans,  such as those in Nepal and Pakistan, provide  excellent examples of planning processes aimed  at ensuring a decentralized and bottom-up planning  process. They are focused on local adaptation  needs and concepts of well-being, but they  are also designed to feed into top-down national  planning processes. Local adaptation plans of  action (LAPAs) take a “vulnerability first” approach  to climate change adaptation, and can be contrasted  with national adaptation programs of  action (NAPAs) in their bottom-up, local approach,  despite being often funded through similar institutions  and mechanisms.  Climate change poses a significant  threat to livelihoods in Nepal.  Temperatures have been rising since  the 1960s with an average increase  of 0.004–0.006oC every year. Rainfall  is becoming increasingly erratic, with  longer dry periods and wetter, more  intense monsoons (Selvaraju 2014).  Reduced rainfall and glacial melt are  contributing to lower water tables,  reduced river flows, landslides, and  flooding. More than two-thirds of  agricultural land in Nepal is rainfed,  thus more erratic rainfall will have  negative impacts on crop yields (World  Bank 2014a).  In September 2010, the Nepalese  government submitted a national  adaptation program of action (NAPA)  to the UNFCCC that identified several  climate resilience projects. To develop  its NAPA, Nepal identified current and  future threats from climate change.  The plan proposed how to combat  them through six sectoral themes  (water and energy, agriculture, forests  and biodiversity, public health, urban  settlements, and disaster risk reduction),  and three crosscutting themes  (livelihoods and governance, gender,  and social inclusion) (Dixit 2012).  The government commissioned a  vulnerability index to quantify the  climate vulnerability of Nepal’s districts and to prioritize the country’s  most vulnerable communities.  Environmental stressors caused in  part by climate change (for example,  forest fires, landslides, floods, and  biodiversity loss) were compared  with adaptive capacity indicators (for  example, poverty levels, literacy levels,  access to irrigation technologies, and  access to drinking water) to determine  overall vulnerability (Ministry of  Environment 2010). The vulnerability  index guided the identification and  prioritization of adaptation needs in  Nepal’s NAPA.  Nepal’s NAPA process focused on  gathering information on climate,  community characteristics, and  vulnerability at the local level  (Dixit 2012). Nepal sent more  than 60 government officials from  different ministries to participate in  consultations with villagers, village  development committee officials,  government agencies, and civil society  representatives. These officials were  tasked with collecting information on  both climate impacts for each sectoral  theme in ecological regions, and on  existing coping strategies used in each  transect region (Dixit 2012).  To inform the public, Nepal’s  government created a website with  information on climate change and  ongoing adaptation activities. The  government also staged events in  rural areas to encourage climate  change awareness (NCCKMC 2014).  Adaptation projects will address the  need for climate resilient modifications  for roads and bridges, water supply  and sanitation, irrigation, urban  development, flood protection, glacier  lake outburst floods, sand mining, and  education (Nepal 2014).  Financing for the development of Nepal’s  NAPA, and for the projects the country  hopes to initiate, was provided by a  number of multilateral donors, including  the Least Developed Country Fund  (LDCF), the United Nations Development  Programme, and the British and Danish  governments (Dixit 2012).  BOX 36 | NEPAL’S NAPA AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITY INDEX  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Nepal developed local adaptation plans  of action (LAPAs), compiled at the  local level by multistakeholder teams,  including vulnerable communities. The  development of LAPAs was in response  to perceived shortcomings of the  UNFCCC’s national adaptation program  of action (NAPA) process undertaken  by Nepal in 2010. Despite successfully  integrating vulnerability assessments  and prioritizing adaptation projects  accordingly, the national plan was still  seen, as being an overly broad, topdown  estimation that did not adequately  capture local needs. Since the impacts  of climate change dramatically changed  from one village to the other, a top-down  process such as a NAPA was considered  ill-equipped to cater for meeting local  needs (Chaudhury et al. 2014).  During the Nepal NAPA consultation  process, suggestions were made  by participants to localize a NAPA,  generating the idea of a concurrent  planning process or LAPA. In 2011,  the Government of Nepal approved  the National Framework on LAPA,  becoming the first country to formalize  LAPA as a national planning framework.  With LAPAs, Nepal hopes to use a  national framework that integrates  top-down with bottom-up approaches,  mainstreams adaptation into  development planning at both the  national and local levels, encourages  participation, identifies local adaptation  needs, and strengthens institutional  mechanisms for ensuring coordinated  adaptation responses (Chaudhury et  al. 2014; Wiseman and Chhetri 2011).  Various national and local agencies  are linked for the delivery of adaptation  resources, with projects that will  lessen the impacts of climate change  on vulnerable communities and help  them build the capacity to tackle future  impacts (Chaudhury et al. 2014). So  far, 70 LAPAs have been completed  and a further 30 are under development  (Chaudhury et al. 2014).  In 2012, Pakistan introduced its own  version of the LAPA, at a project level,  through the Climate Leadership for  Effective Adaptation and Resilience  (CLEAR) project undertaken by  Leadership for Environment and  Development (LEAD) Pakistan, a  nonprofit organization (Chaudhury  et al. 2014). Pakistan’s approach to  developing LAPAs demonstrates the  ability of a local, bottom-up process to  be tailored to targeted groups. Pakistan  uses LAPAs to focus planning efforts  on the most vulnerable districts in the  southern part of the country prone to  floods, cyclones, and drought. CLEAR  is taking a decentralized bottom-up  approach by engaging local partner  organizations from the inception of  the process to develop the LAPAs  to address the impacts of the most  pressing climate change challenges  relevant to local communities. LEAD  facilitates the process by creating an  enabling environment and providing  technical backstopping.  BOX 37 | NEPAL AND PAKISTAN’S LOCAL ADAPTATION PLANS OF ACTION   Community-based adaptation (CBA) recognizes  that small communities are likely to be the most  affected by climate change impacts, least equipped to  adapt to these changes but best placed to determine  locally appropriate long-term plans. CBA recognizes  that all people play an essential role in planning,  implementing, monitoring, and evaluating solutions  to adaptation. Bolivia (Box 38) has used the CBA  model to inform its adaptation planning, integrating  it into its national development planning. Bolivia’s  example demonstrates that ensuring extensive  public engagement in the policymaking process and  investing in improved methods of communication  can build interconnectedness among communities,  which, in itself, strengthens adaptive capacity.  By providing opportunities for the development of  such social resources, governments can facilitate  coordination and cooperation among communities,  enable collective action to provide safety nets in  times of crisis, and develop mechanisms to share  other forms of capital (WRI et al. 2011).  Because local adaptation plans and vulnerability  assessments will need to be embedded in larger  national strategies, it is also important to think  Bolivia contributes only a small fraction of global  GHG emissions (roughly 0.3 percent), so it focuses  its efforts more on climate change adaptation than on  mitigation. To reduce its vulnerability to climate change,  Bolivia has undertaken a series of community-based  adaptation (CBA) projects in conjunction with local  and national nongovernmental organizations, United  Nations Volunteers, and the United Nations Development  Programme. It is funded through the Global Environment  Facility’s Small Grants Programme. (UNDP 2014a; State  of Bolivia 2012).  Participatory approaches are required in all Bolivia’s  climate change adaptation actions (State of Bolivia  2012, 48). Accordingly, Bolivia prioritized its adaptation  projects based, in part, on participatory consultations  (Devisscher and Smith 2008). Bolivia employs a  participatory approach across all six of its CBA  projects, to “strengthen the communities’ resiliency to  climate change through awareness-raising workshops  and capacity-building activities on natural resource  management” (UNDP 2014b, 2).  Bolivia’s indigenous population participates in a CBA  project to reduce deforestation by sustainably harvesting  forest products (State of Bolivia 2012). Another CBA  project, which aims to protect water resources for  irrigation and drinking water, includes communities in the  process of identifying “alternatives for the establishment  and location of irrigation systems” (UNDP 2014c, 2).  Bolivia is now one of 10 countries, including Bangladesh,  Guatemala, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Namibia, Niger,  Samoa, and Vietnam, that implement projects integrating  the concept of CBA in conjunction with UNDP (UNDP  2014c, 2). UNDP’s support of community-based projects  seeks to enhance the resiliency of small, highly vulnerable  communities and the ecosystems on which they rely, to  climate change impacts. It aims to create small-scale policy  laboratories and generate knowledge about how to achieve  adaptation at the local level (UNDP 2014c, 2).  BOX 38 | BOLIVIA’S PARTICIPATORY  APPROACH TO ADAPTATION  Because much of the Netherlands lies below sea  level, the country has a long history of adapting to  encroaching seas and flooding. Without the country’s  series of massive dikes, areas below sea level would be  permanently flooded, and 60 percent of the country—  home to 10 million people—would be threatened by  storm surges (Germanwatch 2004).  The Dutch government is integrating its adaptation  policies with spatial planning policies. Integration has  required it to coordinate adaptation projects with local  and municipal authorities. For example, Rotterdam  Climate Initiative works with nongovernmental  organizations and the regional and municipal authorities  in Rotterdam to make the city more climate resilient  (Rotterdam Climate Initiative 2013). Projects undertaken  include the augmentation and maintenance of flood  prevention systems on rivers and coasts (OECD 2013).  The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment  has identified local authorities, businesses, knowledge  institutions, and consumers, as well as locally focused  entrepreneurs and civil society organizations, as key  partners in developing local approaches to adaptation  (Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment 2014).  BOX 39 | THE NETHERLANDS LOOKS  AT LOCAL APPROACHES TO ADAPTATION  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up about the relationship between scales. The Netherlands  has attempted to link scales directly and has  built its national adaptation plan around local and  municipal authorities (Box 39).  By focusing national adaptation planning around the  experiences and needs of local communities, the Netherlands  expects to be more able to develop long-term  strategies that will protect the population and generate  momentum across all the relevant stakeholders.  Building International Support for  Climate Resilience, Adaptation, and  Loss and Damage  This section builds on the lessons identified in the  previous sections and recommends ways in which  the international community could help support  and scale up these efforts.  Addressing the Needs of the Most Vulnerable  Vulnerable communities have limited capacity to  engage in policymaking, and they risk being overlooked  if their needs are not explicitly included  in planning. To meet their needs, international  support should enable countries to establish   decision-making processes that ensure the participation  of all members of the community, particularly  those most vulnerable and least represented in  formal  decision-making structures. Such support  must recognize that specialized efforts will need  to be invested in engaging particular communities,  including women, indigenous peoples, people  with disabilities, youth and the elderly, and others.  The development of national adaptation plans is a  particularly important area for support, but support  must also be directed toward planning efforts at  regional or local levels.  ▪▪Support and capacity building from bilateral  and multilateral finance sources should enable  NAPs to focus on particularly vulnerable populations  and the needs of future generations within  countries. Outreach and participation will help  to ensure substantial input to the NAPs by those  populations, but efforts should be made to increate  community or locally based adaptation  methods into national planning processes.  ▪▪Regional organizations or agencies should  incorporate the adaptation planning of their  member countries into their development or  adaptation strategies. Where appropriate, communities  whose ethnic ties or pastoral lifestyles  cross national boundaries might benefit from  adaptation planning at the regional level involving  more than one country.  ▪▪The UNFCCC should provide guidance on creating  a vulnerability screen for use within NAPs  that would identify communities with particular  vulnerability. This screen could address a range  of factors contributing to vulnerability including  gender, income disparities, cultural and  social marginalization, and legal status.  ▪▪The UNFCCC should encourage the development  of LAPAs in conjunction with NAPS and NAPAs,  and provide guidance to promote best practice  and participatory approaches, which focus on the  needs of the most vulnerable communities.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral and bilateral  sources must be designed to ensure that it  reaches local communities and targets the most  vulnerable. Financing mechanisms must be designed  to enable projects to be implemented by  the most vulnerable and disadvantaged countries  and communities, tailoring approaches  to context-specific needs, and capitalizing on  communities’ values and strengths.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral and bilateral  sources should support sustained, longterm  (10 years or more) monitoring focused on  the impacts of adaptation efforts on vulnerable  populations. Also, national communications to  the UNFCCC can be used to identify relevant  information about particularly vulnerable  groups and populations and include long-term  monitoring of adaptation activities and program-  wide impacts on capabilities.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral or bilateral  sources should have social and environmental  safeguards ensuring that the most vulnerable  or marginalized are not negatively affected by  adaptation finance.   ▪▪Efforts to assess potential impacts on social  or cultural capabilities should be included  in vulnerability and impact assessments for  sector-specific policymaking. Mapping the  social support systems of communities, particularly  the most vulnerable, can provide insight  into where climate impacts or poorly designed  climate policies are most likely to hinder those  support systems.  Research is Needed for Long-Term  Adaptation Strategies  Despite the importance of resilience and adaptation  strategies, current research efforts are not  adequate to inform effective policy design and plan  for longer-term demand. For instance, very few indepth  long-term evaluations of adaptation efforts  have been conducted or widely disseminated. Similarly,  several key sectors for vulnerable populations,  including climate-resilient agriculture and affordable  climate-resilient and low-carbon building,  remain underresearched globally. Greater efforts  to channel and leverage international research  activities are needed to draw sufficient attention  to these systematically underexamined areas. It is  also essential that such research be conducted with  vulnerable communities to ensure that it resonates  with their core needs and builds on existing practices  and knowledge.  ▪▪Research funders, including bilateral, multilateral  and private foundation funders, should set  aside resources specifically targeted at research  with particularly vulnerable populations. The  benefits of such research must flow to these  communities.  ▪▪Research activities with a focus on the coproduction  of knowledge with vulnerable communities  and populations including women  and indigenous communities should seek to  respect and take account of existing knowledge  to ensure that outcomes are appropriate and  effective.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral and bilateral  sources should support knowledge generation  of climate risks, through prioritizing  projects that enable risk management tools  to be developed for those regions or countries  most vulnerable.  ▪▪As part of its assessment reports, the IPCC  should systematically identify and communicate  research gaps with special attention to  those research areas particularly relevant for  the least well off or most vulnerable. Such areas  include research specifically exploring affordable  climate-resilient building, climate-resilient  agriculture, disaster planning and recovery, and  long-term loss and damage assessments.  ▪▪Assessments of adaptation policy actions  should be systematically collected and distributed  by the UNFCCC Adaptation Committee to  spread effective practices and avoid repetition  of policy choices with unintended consequences  for the most vulnerable.  Loss and Damage Are Likely  The IPCC has recently acknowledged the limits of  adaptation, by asserting that “greater rates and  magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood  of exceeding adaptation limits” and that  “residual loss and damage will occur from climate  change despite adaptation and mitigation action”  (Klein et al. 2014, 903). Knowledge of such limits  is therefore important not only to “inform the level  and timing of mitigation needed” but also to inform  decisionmakers on how best to cope with the  residual impacts of loss and damage. The IPCC has  gone further to state that insufficient responses to  emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for  sustainable development (Klein et al. 2014, 903).  Action must be taken to plan for the effects of slowonset  climate impacts and the increased probabilities  of high-impact climate-related events. It is possible  that long-term development of capabilities, such as  educational opportunities and economic diversification,  could reduce the likelihood of serious loss in  vulnerable communities. Strategic, long-term thinking  about equitable approaches to loss and damage  will necessarily be community specific, and entail  considerable planning and option exploration.  National loss and damage scoping studies can  help with planning  Building on international experience with the  creation of national adaptation plans, vulnerable  countries should be supported to create and submit  “national loss and damage scoping studies” that  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up assess long-term effects of climate change. These  studies should identify specific loss and damage  concerns with particular attention to the most  vulnerable and least well off communities. Like the  NAPs, these scoping studies should empower local  communities and national governments to design  appropriate responses to profound climate impacts.  They should also have a future-oriented component  that identifies potential threats and challenges  from climate change, and lays out potential strategies  for building capabilities and options over the  long-term.  The goal of the scoping studies is to identifiy particular  concerns; build capacity for identifying and  evaluating site-specific loss and damage considerations;  and start a process of long-term planning and  strategizing to address loss and damage as equitably  as possible. Over time, these studies could also provide  a basis for requesting and distributing support.  ▪▪Countries should be supported in conducting  national loss and damage scoping studies, similar  to the current NAP process. Scoping studies  should have a future-oriented component that  seeks to find opportunities and strategies for  enhancing long-term capabilities. This futureoriented  component could build on several  possible techniques, including participatory  visioning and futures scenario building and assessment.  These strategies should explicitly lay  out how they will build capabilities and address  the vulnerability of particular groups to loss  and damage.  ▪▪Support should be made available for the  initial scoping study and to establish relevant  baseline and iterative monitoring focused on  particularly vulnerable and marginalized communities,  including the least well off and future  generations. Planning should also be started for  financing to address impacts identified through  monitoring.  ▪▪National loss and damage scoping studies  should be used to inform decisions about financial  support for loss and damage.  Coordinate multilateral efforts  In 2015, several other global processes of direct  relevance to loss and damage will reach important  milestones. They include the Hyogo Framework for  Action under the United Nations Office for Disaster  Risk Reduction (UNISDR), and the Nansen Initiative  on disaster-induced crossborder displacement.  The UNFCCC should seek to coordinate loss and  damage efforts with these initiatives. For example,  the Hyogo Framework priorities and the Nansen  Initiative principles should influence the frameworks  used to structure national loss and damage  scoping studies. To the extent possible, scoping  studies and future reporting to the loss and damage  mechanism should build on reports to the Hyogo  Framework to prevent unduly burdensome reporting  requirements on vulnerable countries.  Identifying the most  vulnerable populations  or communities, at the  intersection of physical  climate impacts and  social vulnerability,  is among the most  important challenges in  developing adaptation  policies and climate risk  management systems.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up CLIMATE EQUITY,  CAPABILITIES AND  THE 2015 AGREEMENT  This chapter uses the capabilities approach to establish a framework  to address equity in the 2015 agreement through determining the  content of countries’ intended nationally determined contributions  and the agreement itself. The capabilities approach becomes useful  in designing and evaluating country contributions by defining and  establishing basic guidelines for equitable climate change response.  In terms of the international agreement, this approach helps to  identify pathways to enhance capabilities and achieve equity at the  national level through multiple elements of the 2015 agreement.   The new international climate agreement to be  concluded at the end of 2015 is a critical opportunity  to make significant progress toward the goal  of minimizing the risks of climate change. Ideally,  the 2015 Agreement would establish a framework  that facilitates rapid and ambitious mitigation  efforts, effectively supports adaptation and address  loss and damage from climate impacts in the short  term, and lays a foundation for deeper action on all  fronts to protect future generations. Chapters 2 and  3 identified a range of ways that the international  community could support domestic actions that  build capabilities while addressing climate action.  In this section we focus on the opportunity to  address equity in the 2015 Agreement. Equity has  always been central to international policy efforts,  and as noted earlier, the UNFCCC mandate to  reach a 2015 Agreement that is “applicable to all  Parties” and is also “under the Convention” has  further emphasized the equity questions facing  parties. Without an effective approach to equity, the  2015 Agreement is unlikely to build the necessary  consensus to enable strong and ambitious commitments,  and may not be concluded at all.  Two core processes toward the proposed 2015  Agreement present opportunities for addressing  equity, both of which can be advanced based on  an understanding of capabilities. The first is the  process of determining the content of countries’  intended NDCs. The second is determining the  content of the agreement as a whole.  In forming the 2015 Agreement, the capability  approach stresses the importance of prioritizing  the identification of concrete pathways of achieving  climate action and well-being. As seen in Chapters 2  and 3, designing and implementing climate actions  that build capabilities requires a range of resources  and commitments. Mitigation objectives, adaptation  and loss and damage, finance, capacity building,  technology, and transparency and accountability are  all essential elements of climate action, and thus all  must be reflected in the 2015 Agreement. For each  of these elements, recognizing the relationships  between climate action and capabilities is a central  tool for using the 2015 Agreement to advance transformative  changes toward human well-being and  equity in a context of climate change.  Consider Equity in Formulating  Nationally Determined Contributions  In the 2015 negotiations, intended NDCs form the  central mechanism for determining and communicating  national commitments to climate action.  Determining what types of actions individual countries  will take and how much they will do—both in  terms of the aggregate level of action undertaken by  UNFCCC Parties and in terms of countries’ national  levels of action—is a core equity issue. A capabilities  approach is useful in this conversation because it  establishes basic guidelines about what an equitable  response to climate change would look like  in the aggregate. In addition, using the concept of  respective capabilities can provide a framework that  informs how each country’s contributions should be  determined according to equity.  The process for setting those contributions is a  hybrid one, combining national proposals for actions  with the overarching framework of the Convention.  The process will begin by those Parties ready to  do so, communicating their intended NDCs to the  UNFCCC Secretariat by the first quarter of 2015 and  those remaining at least “well in advance” of COP 21  (UNFCCC 2013b). In accordance with the decision  made by the Parties in Warsaw, the information  that Parties may provide with their intended NDCs  was agreed upon at COP 20 in Lima (UNFCCC  2014). While the provision of this information is  not mandatory, Parties did agree an indicative list  of information that could form the basis of Parties’  intended NDCs. Of particular relevance, is the invitation  in paragraph 14 for Parties to include how it  ”considers that its intended nationally determined  contribution is fair and ambitious, in light of its  national circumstances, and how it contributes  towards achieving the objective of the Convention  as set out in its Article 2” (UNFCCC 2014).  Despite many Parties pushing for a formal review  and assessment phase to follow communication of  the intended NDCs (see, for example, Africa Group  2013; Africa Group 2014; Mexico 2014; CAN International  2013), no ex ante assessment was agreed in  the Lima Call for Climate Action (UNFCCC 2014).  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up In light of both decisions at COP 20, as countries formulate  their intended NDCs, this report proposes that  a core bundle of national capabilities should be central  to the factors used to define and evaluate the equitability  of countries’ contributions. These national  capabilities, described in Chapter 1 and building off  the capabilities approach developed throughout this  report, can be used to put into practice and enhance  the respective capabilities aspect of the CBDR-RC  principle in the Convention. National capabilities  can be useful as a means to consider the degree to  which countries are able to take climate action and to  identify opportunities for climate action to contribute  to domestic development priorities.  Capabilities need not become the sole framework  for pursuing climate equity. Responsibility for  climate change, including historical responsibility,  remains fundamental to shaping global climate  efforts. It is also relevant because of the role that  emissions have played in causing significant climate  impacts and affecting the capabilities of countries  and particularly vulnerable populations.  Accordingly, we propose that intended NDCs  be formulated and evaluated in terms of the  following factors:  ▪▪Emissions responsibility, including historical,  current, and projected emissions both in per  capita and aggregate terms  ▪▪National capabilities, including:  □□ human development;  □□ economic capacity, including consideration  of the relative costs of climate action and  the economic benefits from taking climate  action;  □□ resilience to climate impacts, including  physical security and capacity to adapt in  the face of climate change; and  □□ governance capacity and social support  structures  The level of these four country capabilities can be  assessed using specific quantitative and qualitative  metrics, shown in Table 6 below and introduced  earlier in Chapter 1, Table 3. These metrics can help  assess the relative strength of different countries’  capabilities to determine the level and types of  action they could take. Using capabilities in this way  reflects the many dimensions of equity and expressly  acknowledges the differences among countries,  though differences between developed and developing  countries are still quite evident. Together with  emissions indicators, these indicators can be instructive  in assessing the degree and types of actions that  countries can undertake. Although incorporating  these indicators should not provide an exact answer  to the question of what type and level of action a  country should take, it can help provide the basis  for a constructive examination and decision making  process regarding intended NDCs.    When communicating their intended NDCs in  accordance with the requirements of the Lima Call  for Climate Action, Parties should explain how their  countries’ proposed actions compare with other  countries’ in terms of equity, based on the factors  and indicators described earlier. This consideration  of equity should be undertaken together with  assessment of the countries’ technical and economic  opportunities for mitigation action and how the  countries’ actions contribute to the collective global  goal of keeping temperature rise below 2o C.  Along with other upfront information, such as that  regarding sectors and gases covered in emissions  plans, countries should indicate the specific criteria  and factors they use in determining the equitability  of their contribution, as well as how the contribution  fits into a global level of ambition to reduce  emissions. (Levin et al. 2014).  Formulating Policies and Actions in National  Contributions  Incorporating equity factors into the formulation  and assessment of intended NDCs, both during  2015 as well as in the 2015 Agreement, can help  determine the type and level of contributions a  country should make.  Mitigation in Intended Nationally Determined  Contributions  In the case of mitigation, this approach would suggest  that developed countries and others with the most  robust capabilities should take on emission reduction  targets that clearly link to the global stabilization levels  required to avoid further climate impacts. To reach  the level of ambition needed, targets would have to  provide for absolute, economy-wide emissions reductions,  while they could also include specific long-term  goals such as phase-outs of GHGs.  WRI’s CAIT Equity Explorer tool (Box 40) allows  comparison of countries by climate, economic, and  resilience indicators to show the relative level of  action countries could take in each area.  For those countries that have the ability to do so,  based on their capabilities, GHG reduction targets  should be put forward. However, to take account of  policy effects on those who are least well off domestically,  targets can be less comprehensive—such as  emissions intensity targets or emission peak dates—  and will need to be pursued equitably in a domestic  context. Efforts should be taken to avoid future  emissions and enable long-term emission reductions.  For this reason, policies that include building  low-carbon infrastructure—including energy  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up infrastructure—and developing robust land-use  management may be particularly appropriate.  Countries with the lowest capabilities should focus  on seeking opportunities for climate actions that  contribute to national capabilities. This might  include efforts to support renewable energy electrification,  or to enable community forest management.  Of course, the overarching requirement of  sufficient mitigation to protect future capabilities  means that in all cases, countries should commit  to an increasingly ambitious type and level of  contribution; there should be no backsliding from  previous types of commitments such as economy-wide,  absolute emissions targets. Table 7 suggests a  spectrum approach to determine the type of extent  of mitigation contribution that could be proposed  by a range of country Parties.      Source: Adapted from CAIT Equity Explorer, World Resources Institute.  The World Resources Institute has created an online  tool, the CAIT Equity Explorer that can be used to  examine a wide range of equity factors in national  dialogues and  decision-making processes on intended  nationally determined contributions, as well as by  UNFCCC Parties and stakeholders during the review  and assessment phase of these contributions. Tools  such as the CAIT Equity Explorer can assist countries  and other stakeholders in assessing and comparing the  implications of using different dimensions of equity  within intended national contributions.  The factors incorporated in the equity explorer include  emissions, development, vulnerability, relative costs of  action, and benefits of action. It integrates indicators  graphically and enables users to choose the factors they  would like to consider and compare countries’ profiles  based on these indicators. In general, the greater the  area covered in each radar chart, the greater level of  action a country could undertake. As the examples below  highlight, choosing different indicators provides different  perspectives on relative equity among countries.  BOX 40 | CAIT EQUITY EXPLORER   As seen in Table 7, in addition to signaling levels  of effort internationally, defining their intended  NDCs, and reporting on the level of fairness and  ambition, provides countries with an opportunity  to formulate climate actions that are deliberately  designed to build the capabilities of the least well  off and most vulnerable from the bottom-up. In the  case of low-carbon development, the types of lowcarbon  policies highlighted in Chapter 2 could form  the basis of policies and measures that countries  include in their intended NDCs, such as those listed  in Box 40.  Including adaptation in intended NDCs  From a capabilities perspective, mitigation is  not the only dimension that should be included  in intended NDCs. If the goal of intended NDCs  is to create a mechanism capable of identifying  policy efforts and encouraging consistently deeper  national action sufficient to avoid negative climate  impacts for current and future generations, then  adaptation should also be included. This also  reflects the position of a number of developing  country Parties, who are strongly in favor of adaptation  being equally reflected (Environmental Integrity  Group 2014; Mexico 2014).  Given that many countries’ long-term adaptation  plans are not complete, fully incorporating adaptation  may be pragmatically difficult for many Parties  at this stage. However given the importance of  adaptation to capabilities, the intended NDCs could  still provide Parties an opportunity to present their  adaptation planning processes, needs, and contributions.  Adaptation contributions could largely  focus on the national strategy and planning processes  for adaptation (such as to formulate NAPs),  rather than prematurely attempting to articulate  specific actions or outcomes. Parties could include  information about timelines, ministries involved,  and sectors and geographies covered in the NAPs  planning process in each country. Following 2015,  as countries more fully formulate their NAPs and  other adaptation strategies, they could augment  their future adaptation contributions with more  specific information and plans.  Financing nationally determined contributions  Similarly, given that pursuing equitable climate  policies—for either mitigation or adaptation—may  require additional financing, a capabilities approach  would support the inclusion of finance for intended  NDCs to the extent that it is needed for particular  policy shifts. For instance, implementing equitable  fossil-fuel subsidy reform may require an initial  financial investment that countries could note in  their proposed contribution.  Various UNFCCC Parties have suggested that  contributions from developing country Parties  should be enabled and supported by finance from  developed country Parties and that intended NDCs  should reflect the need for and provision of finance  (Least Developed Countries 2014; South Africa  2014). Particularly for countries with limited capabilities,  the proposed national contributions are an  opportunity to highlight their needs for support tied  to specific policy issues identified as useful both for  climate action and for improving well-being. One  approach to addressing this link to finance would be  for developing countries to indicate those activities  and measures they will undertake unconditionally,  without support, and those that will require international  support.  Presenting their contributions in this way would  enable developing countries to assess and communicate  their capabilities and the degree to which  support, including finance and capacity building, is  needed to bolster those capabilities.  Assessing Countries’ Intended Nationally  Determined Contributions  As discussed earlier, equity demands adequate  global mitigation and sufficient adaptation to avoid  further climate-induced reductions in capabilities,  also requiring that climate actions protect or  enhance the capabilities of those who are least well  off or most vulnerable. Together these requirements  provide basic guidance for sufficient global action  in the aggregate over time. Although each country  will determine its own contribution, the capabilities  approach insists that sufficient global action is a  Examples of policies countries might put forth in their  intended nationally determined contributions that  incorporate equitability include:  ▪▪Equitable fossil-fuel subsidy reform with use of fiscal  savings for social benefits such as health and education  ▪▪Carbon pricing systems designed equitably and with  use of revenues for social benefits  ▪▪Renewable energy policies, including feed-in tariffs  and off-grid distributed renewable systems, designed  to expand energy access and address equity concerns  ▪▪Sustainable transport efforts focused on meeting  transportation access needs for the least well off  ▪▪Community forest rights policies and programs that  enable reductions in deforestation  ▪▪Adaptation planning processes that highlight the  needs and interests of the most vulnerable populations,  including vulnerability screens that take into  account differing capabilities    core requirement for equity. Reviews and synthesis  of the intended NDCs, undertaken either by civil  society or the UNFCCC Secretariat, must therefore  not only consider the range of respective capabilities  and responsibilities, but must also evaluate  them in the aggregate against global needs.  In whatever manner a review process is undertaken,  a capability approach suggests that a  robust assessment is needed to consider whether  countries’ contributions are equitable in relation  to one another, as well as how far they go in meeting  collective goals of keeping global temperature  rise below 2oC. Following the absence of a formal  ex ante assessment process in the Lima Call for  Climate Action, ensuring that the review process  includes a rigorous aggregate assessment will  require contributions from outside the UNFCCC,  such as those from civil society or research institutions  or by an international body such as the United  Nations Environment Programme.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Promoting Capabilities through Multiple  Elements of the 2015 Agreement  As shown in Chapters 2 and 3, achieving sufficient  climate action that protects and builds capabilities  in the long run necessarily requires a wide range of  political, institutional, and financial support. These  needs cut across all elements of the 2015 Agreement.  While the intended NDCs are a central tool for defining  and communicating country contributions, each of  the broader elements of a 2015 agreement—including  mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology, transparency  and accountability, and capacity building—play  a role in creating a foundation for climate action  that will achieve climate stabilization and protect or  enhance capabilities in the long term. This section  uses the capabilities approach as a lens to identify  what would be required to promote the long-term  goals of the UNFCCC in each of these key elements of  a 2015 Agreement, both the resulting legal text as well  as any accompanying decisions of the COP.  Focus Adaptation Policies on the  Most Vulnerable Populations  As described in Chapter 3, the need to adapt to the  effects of climate change and address impacts on the  most vulnerable populations is a central equity concern.  A capabilities approach highlights the role that  well-designed adaptation policies can play in protecting  and increasing the well-being of those populations.  The Convention recognizes the importance of  adaptation for human well-being (UNFCCC 1992). In  recent years, the Cancun Adaptation Framework and  the process for developing national adaptation plans  have underscored the importance of an emphasis on  building resilience to climate impacts, especially in an  integrated fashion with broader development objectives  (UNFCCC 2011a; LDC Expert Group 2012).  The Cancun Adaptation Framework provides that  “[E]nhanced action on adaptation should be undertaken  in accordance with the Convention, should  follow a country driven, gender-sensitive, participatory  and fully transparent approach, taking into  consideration vulnerable groups, communities, and  ecosystems, and should be based on and guided  by the best available science, and, as appropriate,  traditional and indigenous knowledge, with a view to  integrating adaptation into relevant social, economic  and environmental policies and actions, where  appropriate” (UNFCCC 2010, sec. II, para. 12).  The negotiation process for the 2015 Agreement,  including accompanying COP decisions, provides an  opportunity to build on this framework by promoting  accelerated implementation of adaptation action,  with a central focus on particularly vulnerable populations.  To drive this implementation and send clear  long-term policy signals to key actors—including  national and local governments, international institutions,  the private sector and civil society—the 2015  Agreement should include a long-term adaptation  goal that focuses attention on the most vulnerable  populations and the need to undertake adaptation in  ways that address their basic capabilities (Okereke,  Baral and Dagnet 2014).  Effectively pursuing this goal will depend on  widening the use of vulnerability assessments that  address the intersection of climate impacts with  economic, social, gender, and other factors. NAPs,  other adaptation plans, and adaptation finance  strategies will need to use these types of assessments  to prioritize pathways for addressing impacts  on the most vulnerable. This will require attention  to a wide range of development priorities—including  health, habitation, and water—and attention to  the ways in which adaptation must be integrated  with overarching development strategies and plans.  As Chapter 3 described, adaptation approaches must  be highly specific to particular localities and populations,  and effective adaptation planning and assessment  processes require participatory processes and  local engagement. Therefore, the 2015 Agreement  should emphasize the importance of participatory  approaches and ensure that countries receive the support  needed, including finance and technical assistance,  to undertake this engagement. While developing  countries are clearly the focus for most of this  effort, adaptation and resilience building also should  address the effects of climate change on particularly  vulnerable populations in developed countries.  Finally, the 2015 Agreement should also explicitly  acknowledge the inherent relationship between  the level of mitigation pursued by countries and  the resulting effects on capabilities as emissions  rise and climate change accelerates. To put this  recognition into practice, the agreement should  include a process to assess the degree to which the  need for adaptation measures will be affected by  the expected level of mitigation that countries will   undertake and the temperature trajectory that will  result. In addition, the agreement should provide  for an assessment of the extent to which adaptation  efforts underway are successfully addressing existing  and projected adaptation needs. Such assessment  processes can be part of the regular cycles  of action in the agreement, and Parties should be  encouraged in future cycles to submit descriptions  of their adaptation efforts informed by NAPs and  other national adaptation plans as those reach  completion (Morgan, Dagnet, and Tirpak 2014).  Specific recommendations for building capabilities  through adaptation and resilience in the 2015  Agreement process:  ▪▪The Parties to the UNFCCC should use the  2015 Agreement to reaffirm and further implement  key provisions in the Cancun Adaptation  Framework, which states that adaptation  “should follow a country driven, gendersensitive,  participatory and fully transparent  approach, taking into consideration vulnerable  groups, communities, and ecosystems.”  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should include an adaptation  goal that emphasizes the need to undertake  adaptation and build resilience for the most  vulnerable populations. The agreement should  encourage all countries, including developed  countries, to develop adaptation and resilience  strategies for their most vulnerable populations.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should explicitly recognize  the relationship between the level of global  mitigation effort and the adaptation response  needed and assess the resulting adaptation  need on a regular basis.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should emphasize the  importance of participatory planning approaches  in developing NAPs and other adaptation plans,  to ensure substantial input by those populations  that are most vulnerable and least represented.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should ensure that support  and capacity building will enable developing  countries to continue to develop NAPS and  other adaptation strategies in conjunction with  other development strategies, including regular  updates on a nationally determined schedule.  ▪▪To address adaptation needs, the 2015 Agreement  should support shifting international public  finance to a fully balanced allocation so that  adaptation receives an equal level of funding  compared with mitigation.  ▪▪Countries’ national communications to the  UNFCCC provide an opportunity for developing  countries to identify and communicate the  needs of specific populations.  Loss and damage caused by climate change  impacts is already being experienced and, even  with significant mitigation efforts, more impacts  will occur based on already emitted GHGs (IPCC  2013). Addressing loss and damage is essential in  an equitable climate regime because of the unequal  impacts that will be faced by the most vulnerable,  despite their having contributed the least  emissions. One of the key outcomes of COP 19 in  Warsaw was the establishment of an international  mechanism to address loss and damage experienced  by developing countries. The Warsaw International  Mechanism for Loss and Damage (Loss  and Damage Mechanism) was established under  the Cancun Adaptation Framework and is intended  to examine and find ways to address climate-related  extreme and slow-onset events occurring or likely  to occur in developing countries that are particularly  vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate  change (UNFCCC 2013b).  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should emphasize the  need for cooperation toward achieving universal  access to climate information, including  early-warning systems, weather stations, and  agriculture-relevant climate information.  ▪▪The COP should provide guidance to the governing  bodies of the Loss and Damage Mechanism,  the Technology Mechanism and the  Financial Mechanism of the UNFCCC should be  encouraged to look for opportunities to support  countries with lower capabilities to access innovative  information technologies necessary to  support vulnerable populations.  ▪▪The COP should support the development of  national loss and damage scoping studies,  highlighting the importance of addressing loss  and damage through a permanent but dynamic  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up process in countries. These scoping studies  would assess the current and future impacts  of climate change leading to loss and damage  and approaches to deal with those effects in  each country.  ▪▪The COP should recognize the need for collaboration  and coordination among the Loss and  Damage Mechanism and other United Nations  disaster risk reduction programs, such as the  Hyogo Framework for Action under the United  Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction  and the Nansen Initiative on disaster-induced  cross-border displacement.  Target Finance to Build Capabilities  Climate finance will be essential to the task of  undertaking equitable climate action in line with a  capabilities approach. To support capabilities, and  address equity in climate finance, the 2015 Agreement  can play three key roles:  ▪▪Create the post-2020 framework necessary to  generate the level of finance and investment  needed to pursue low-carbon development and  to build resilience and adapt to climate impacts,  based on countries’ capabilities  ▪▪Send a strong policy signal to financial institutions  that finance and investment should  be directed toward equitable climate action  that builds capabilities, such as those policies  described in Chapters 2 and 3, and that finance  should be accessible to those who are least well  off and most vulnerable  ▪▪Promote the alignment of development finance  with climate objectives to ensure that development  priorities are implemented in a way that  builds capabilities in a changing climate.  Generating the finance and investment needed  The recent report of the Global Commission on the  Economy and Climate demonstrated that climate  action can provide substantial economic benefits.  With US$90 trillion set to be invested globally in  urban, land-use, and energy infrastructure in the  next 15 years, numerous opportunities are available  to advance low-carbon development at relatively  low cost, including in countries with lower levels of  capabilities (Global Commission on the Economy  and Climate, 2014).  Yet for many developing countries, upfront investment  to pursue low-carbon pathways will still be  necessary; the investment needed to achieve the  level of mitigation and adaptation necessary to protect  future generations from the impacts of climate  change is several orders of magnitude larger than  what current financial flows, public and private, can  provide. It has been estimated that between now  and 2050, developing countries alone will require  an additional $531 billion per year of investment  in energy supply and demand technologies to  keep average global temperature rise below 2oC  (Polycarp, Brown, and Fu-Bertaux 2013). Climate  finance flows to developing countries currently total  $165 billion annually, though only $34 billion of  that total comes from developed countries (Climate  Policy Initiative 2014).  Financial support is needed to enable the kinds of  policies described in Chapters 2 and 3. In many cases,  shifts to low-carbon energy, transport, and infrastructure  and the implementation of effective adaptation  and resilience actions will require significant upfront  investment. However, many of the countries in which  these efforts will be necessary will be unable to finance  them directly. Addressing these finance needs so that  those countries with less robust national capabilities  can take climate action will depend on the new international  agreement catalyzing a scale-up of various types  of finance in the post-2020 timeframe. The financial  pathways needed to support the commitments made  under the 2015 Agreement include direct international  grants, concessional and nonconcessional lending,  guarantees to reduce the risk in innovative investments,  and the involvement of the private sector, including  small and medium enterprises.  To ensure that finance is available to enhance the  capabilities of countries and communities, the  2015 Agreement must create a new framework for  post-2020 climate finance. The goal agreed to at  Copenhagen and Cancun to mobilize $100 billion in  climate finance annually by 2020 sets an important  initial benchmark for the 2015 Agreement to use as a  floor for climate finance in the post-2020 period. The  2015 Agreement can also set another key marker for  post-2020 finance by identifying targets for future  replenishment of the Green Climate Fund.   Beyond these essential elements to set a foundation  on finance, the 2015 Agreement should also link  post-2020 finance to developing countries’ identification  of the finance needed to achieve the nationally  determined contributions they put forward. Developing  country Parties should explicitly be given an  opportunity in their intended NDCs to identify two  sets of policies and actions. The first will include the  level of ambition committed to on the basis of existing  domestic resources and the second, acknowledging  the importance of capabilities, will identify the  increased ambition achievable with international  support. To enable these countries to build their  capabilities and take the enhanced action, finance  commitments in the 2015 Agreement should be  linked to the needs expressed in the intended NDCs,  including a mechanism to ensure that those finance  and investment needs will be met.  To meet these financial commitments, developed  countries remain responsible for supporting  developing countries to undertake climate action,  as laid out in Article 4 of the UNFCCC, and clearly  continue to have a lead responsibility for finance.  Nonetheless, given the shifting global economic  landscape, applying a capabilities approach to  climate finance supports recognition in the 2015  Agreement of the full range of global climate  financial flows, not just from developed to developing  countries. Given their growing capabilities,  many developing countries with relatively robust  capabilities are indicating their readiness to make  financial commitments, either to support significant  South-South financial flows or to contribute to the  capitalization of the Green Climate Fund (see, for  example, Mexico 2014; Marshall Islands 2014;  South Africa 2013; China 2014).  A recurrent theme throughout this report has been  the need for adequate climate finance, beyond  existing North-South flows, to provide the upfront  finance needed to drive equitable climate policies.  Providing the opportunity for all Parties to contribute  is an important first step. The 2015 Agreement  can create the framework for post-2020 climate  finance, by recognizing a range of financial contributions,  including quantitative pledges, targets,  and actions, as well as qualitative commitments on  domestic policies and programs aimed at mobilizing  climate finance. All Parties should be encouraged to  contribute to the global discussion on climate finance  through indicating their intention as to finance in  their intended NDCs, recognizing its importance to  building capabilities and achieving equity.  It is becoming apparent that despite best efforts  to increase global public finance, even ambitious  targets will fall short of the level of finance needed  to shift investments and keep global temperatures  below 2oC. The 2015 Agreement must therefore  play a key role in creating a 2020 framework that  supports and guides long-term involvement of  the private sector in climate finance, particularly  including businesses in developing countries. From  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up a capabilities and equity perspective, this calls for  not just an increase in private-sector investment,  but a focus on ensuring that such investment is  directed toward building the capabilities of the  least well off and most vulnerable. This presents a  particularly unique challenge given the difficulties  in directing private finance and putting safeguards  in place.  The 2015 Agreement, therefore, has a dual role in  promoting equitable private finance. First, it should  galvanize support to ensure public funding flows  are directed, where appropriate, toward leveraging  private-sector investment. The Parties should  agree on the importance of directing such support  toward sectors that provide opportunities to build  capabilities. Critically, the Parties should highlight  the importance of financing developing-country  businesses—especially reducing risk for small and  medium enterprises—as a way to support innovation  and build capabilities. Second, it must also  highlight the importance of targeting public funding  toward projects for which private funding is  likely to remain scare: historically, adaptation and  resilience projects in low-income countries (which  receive just 2.5 percent of foreign direct investment  to developing countries). While concessional  lending and leveraging the private sector may be  appropriate for developing countries that have  greater capabilities, those with lower capabilities  may still require substantial grant-based finance.  Directing the finance to build capabilities  The challenge for climate finance goes much further  than just finding more money; it is also fundamentally  a governance challenge. Tackling climate  change will require transformational approaches  that accelerate the shift to low-carbon pathways  and bolster climate resilience in ways that are also  fully integrated with efforts to build capabilities and  enhance equity. The 2015 agreement can play an  important role by providing guidance to multilateral  and bilateral finance institutions, including the  GCF, to focus attention on these types of policies.  This includes ensuring that finance and investment  is available for the types of climate actions  described in Chapters 2 and 3 of this report. A  range of financial instruments should be provided  to enable developing countries to pursue low-carbon  policies that take equity into account and help  build capabilities, such as those described earlier  involving fossil-fuel subsidy reform, carbon pricing,  renewable energy provision, sustainable transport  and community forest protection (Polycarp, Brown,  and Fu-Bertaux 2013).  At the same time, finance should be provided for  adaptation focused on building the resilience of  the most vulnerable populations and taking into  account the social and economic contexts that affect  capabilities and vulnerability.   In addition, those requiring finance in many policy  areas are likely to be “nontraditional” recipients,  including women, low-income people, indigenous  peoples and otherwise vulnerable or marginalized  communities. As highlighted in this report, individuals  within these communities have the potential to  develop effective and locally appropriate solutions  but first require access to finance. Financial institutions  should enable these communities to access  funds and enable them to innovate, take risks  and build locally appropriate enterprises to drive  solutions essential to building capabilities and the  achievement of equity.  The orientation of international public finance  can also play a critical role in leveraging domestic  support to enable institutional capacity building  and buy-in within countries. Thinking more broadly  about the role of climate finance in increasing  capabilities supports a model of climate finance that  supports full recipient country ownership. Accordingly,  finance must be prioritized toward readiness  and capacity-building strategies that build longterm  national and subnational institutions and  systems (Polycarp, Brown, and Fu-Bertaux 2013).  This also includes delivering and implementing  climate finance in line with national low-carbon  and adaptation strategies and plans, as well as  providing support for developing and updating  those plans as needed. In addition, a capabilities  approach entails providing support for government  capacity to develop and oversee policies, build linkages  among ministries and with local government,  and engage the private sector and civil society. To  achieve this, continued support will be essential for  finance mechanisms that enable countries to steer  the strategic direction of finance implementation,  including national finance strategies, and to have  direct access to finance.  Aligning development finance with climate objectives  In addition to leveraging “new and additional”  finance and increasing the accessibility of climate  finance, the 2015 Agreement provides the opportunity  to further align existing development finance  with climate objectives. To date, financing for  climate and development has been institutionally  fragmented despite significant obvious overlaps in  investment needs.  Close to one quarter of all development assistance  currently goes to sectors that are highly relevant  to climate change because they are highly climate  sensitive or offer sizeable mitigation opportunities:  $11.4 billion of total overseas development  assistance in 2011 was for the energy sector, $10.7  billion for agriculture, and $12.6 billion for transport  (OECD 2014).  As the climate changes, development aid must take  into account climate impacts and hazards and plan  accordingly, particularly to build the long-term  capabilities of individuals and communities. Aligning  development finance would not entail shifting  funds from development to climate purposes, but  rather investing those funds in ways that ensure  that both development aims and climate objectives  are met. For instance, investments in the water  sector or agriculture can be made with climate  resilience embedded. Infrastructure investments  can be made in ways that encourage low-carbon  approaches and also help ensure resilience.  Key recommendations for a proposed framework  within the 2015 Agreement to ensure that climate  finance is adequate, addresses equity considerations,  and incorporates an emphasis on capabilities are:  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should link the finance  to be provided in the post-2020 period with  the finance needs communicated in developing  countries’ national plans and intended NDCs to  strengthen their capabilities.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should provide for and  recognize financial contributions coming from  a range of countries, including developing  countries in a position to do so based on their  capabilities.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should also urge that  adaptation and climate resilience finance be  directed toward the most vulnerable populations,  possibly by using social and economic  vulnerability criteria.  ▪▪The COP should emphasize the importance of  integrating considerations of climate risk and  vulnerability assessments into future development  aid. Furthermore, it should highlight the  importance of developing guiding principles  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up for international development finance, which  explicitly consider linkages to climate finance  and harmonization of approaches.  ▪▪The COP should emphasize the importance of  providing support for country readiness and the  development of long-term national institutions  and strategies as a way to enhance national  capabilities.  ▪▪In providing guidance to the Green Climate  Fund and Global Environment Facility, the COP  should emphasize the need to support countries  to undertake equitable climate policies, such  as those involving fossil-fuel subsidy reform,  carbon pricing, sustainable transport, and  renewable energy deployment. The COP should  also highlight the need for climate finance to  be accessible to nontraditional banking populations  including the poor, women, and other  marginalized groups.  Build Capacity to Strengthen Capabilities  Many governments in countries where capabilities  are limited are still unable to undertake the  analysis, planning, and coordination they need to  formulate and undertake climate actions (UNFCCC  2014). Moreover, the private sector and civil society  often require training and technical assistance to  effectively pursue low-carbon and climate-resilient  activities. Many factors have contributed to the  absence of effective capacity building, including  a lack of long-term funding and commitment by  financial institutions and governments (GEF 2013).  Given the ongoing concerns about capacity building,  addressing the need for enhanced capacity is  a fundamental condition for success in the effort  to shift to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies  and for building the capabilities of countries.  Robust capacity-building efforts can further the  integration of a capabilities approach across all  elements of the 2015 Agreement. The agreement  provides the opportunity to address the obstacles  to effective capacity building and build greater  international consensus and consistency in funding  and commitment.  To meet these objectives, the 2015 Agreement  should establish a dedicated capacity building facility  (Morgan, Dagnet, and Tirpak 2014). The facility  would act as a focal point to design, coordinate,  support, and manage all capacity building activities  under the UNFCCC. This would include support for  capacity to:  ▪▪Design and implement climate policies and  programs, including both low-carbon pathways  and climate resilience  ▪▪Collect and assess climate data and information,  including emissions data, climate impacts,  effects of climate policies, and implications on  capabilities, particularly for the most vulnerable  and least well off  ▪▪Coordinate effectively across ministries and  among levels of government  ▪▪Engage with and ensure inclusive participation  of civil society, including the most vulnerable  and least well off populations  ▪▪Engage with private sector, including small and  medium enterprises.  In addition, Parties should agree to provide capacity  building through bilateral programs across all areas  of the agreement, including mitigation, adaptation,  technology, and transparency and accountability.  The agreement should also welcome capacity building  and cooperation among developing countries to  enable shared learning and technical assistance.  Use Innovative Technologies to Build Capabilities  The availability of technology is often highly  relevant to building capabilities and undertaking  effective and equitable climate action. The dissemination  and use of low-carbon and climate-resilient  technologies and practices can be essential to the  ability of countries with limited capabilities to take  action. The Convention requires Annex II Parties to  “take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and  finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to,  environmentally sound technologies and know-how  to other Parties, particularly to developing countries  to enable them to implement the provisions of  the Convention” (UNFCCC 1992, Article 4.5).  In 2010, COP 16 in Cancun established the  UNFCCC Technology Mechanism, consisting of two   bodies, the Technology Executive Committee (TEC)  and the Climate Technology Center and Network  (CTCN) (UNFCCC 2010). The Technology Mechanism’s  mandate is geared toward fostering innovation  and technology development as opposed to a  limited focus on technology transfer. It is intended  to promote innovation of environmentally sound  technologies and their diffusion through cooperation  and international partnerships and by enhancing  the ability of developing countries to maintain,  operate, and adapt technologies. However, the  Technology Mechanism has been constrained in  achieving its mandate largely by funding limitations  (Gehl Sampath, Mugabe, and Barton 2012).  In 2013, the UNFCCC Secretariat surveyed the  technology needs of developing countries. For  adaptation, crop management was a priority,  including technologies for crop improvement, new  varieties, and drought-resistant, saline-tolerant and  short-maturing varieties (UNFCCC 2013a) . Mitigation  technologies prioritized included renewable  energy technologies such as solar electricity,  biomass, and biogas, followed by efficient lighting  and wind turbines.  Technologies can be particularly important to  enable the most vulnerable and least well off to  take action (OECD/IEA 2010). As described in  Chapter 2, distributed solar energy technologies  have enabled communities lacking access to gridbased  electricity to achieve improvements in health  and increased economic opportunities for both men  and women. In many instances, such as with rice  cultivation, an innovative practice does not require  sophisticated technology but may require significant  research concerning its efficacy and feasibility  (Oxfam 2014). Furthermore, important technological  innovations for a particular locality may involve  a focus on dissemination of indigenous practices  that have fallen into disuse. Applying a capabilities  approach to understanding technological needs  forces a broader understanding of technology transfer  that highlights the importance of supporting  research, fostering innovation, and identifying and  implementing locally appropriate technology  or know-how.  The ability of developing countries to “leapfrog”  technology innovation and adopt the most innovative  practices depends on technological absorption  capacities and government intervention that may  not be in place (Gallagher, Holdren, and Sagar  2006) . Successful technology projects carefully  select the appropriate technology to transfer, taking  into account the local reality into which the technology  will be transferred and understanding the  capabilities of the potential end users. Successful  implementation will contribute to developing the  country’s capacity to adopt further technological  developments. This approach can enhance capabilities  and enable countries to “assess the need, select,  import, assimilate, adapt and develop the appropriate  technologies” (Kathuria 2002).  From a capabilities perspective, the 2015 Agreement  can play an essential role by emphasizing  the need to build the capabilities and absorptive  capacity of countries so that they can deploy and  use innovative technologies. In particular, attention  must be paid to the implications of specific innovative  technologies for the least well off and most vulnerable  populations. Innovations must be designed,  for example, to allow communities without energy  access to adopt renewable energy on a broader  basis, such as through the use of improved battery  storage technology (Alliance for Rural Electrification  2013). The 2015 Agreement should empower  creation of a dedicated facility for joint research,  development, and deployment (RD&D) programs  with an emphasis on technologies that can be used  by particularly vulnerable or marginal populations.  Recommendations aimed at enhancing the role of  the Technology Mechanism to achieve equitable  and appropriate technology diffusion to those most  vulnerable and least well off include the following:  ▪▪The Technology Mechanism should be anchored  in the 2015 Agreement, ensuring enhanced  action on technology development and  transfer within the ambit and objectives of the  agreement.  ▪▪The Technology Mechanism should be explicitly  empowered to create an RD&D facility with  a focus on fostering innovative technologies  aimed at the most vulnerable and least well off.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should emphasize the importance  of undertaking readiness work, assisting  the recipient country to assimilate potential  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up technologies in a way that builds its long-term  capabilities and enables new technology to be  widely adopted.  ▪▪The COP should explore ways to link the Technology  Mechanism and the Green Climate Fund  to ensure adequate funding for the deployment  of innovative technology and the dissemination  of underused indigenous technologies.  Focus Transparency and Accountability  on Capabilities  Transparency and accountability are essential for a  climate agreement capable of tracking progress and  deepening climate action over time. Identifying and  reporting information on national emissions, on the  effect of mitigation policies, and on financial flows  can provide an important means of building trust  and enabling cooperative action among countries.  The 2015 Agreement provides an opportunity to  establish a goal for a post-2020 measurement,  reporting, and verification (MRV) framework that  moves toward more uniform MRV and facilitates  the evaluation of progress on climate action. It can  also help in providing increased data and information  about the ways in which climate policies  directly affect capabilities in a country.  Despite the importance of implementing a comprehensive  system for MRV, however, the success of  MRV largely depends on the governance capabilities  of the Parties. Parties must have sufficient technical  expertise available, be capable of conducting assessments,  and have the institutional capacity to effectively  manage these processes. Without sufficient  resources, MRV requirements are likely to encumber  already stretched governance systems in many  countries. Such differences in national governance  capabilities means that attempts to include comprehensive  MRV systems in the 2015 Agreement must  factor in the time and resources necessary to support  MRV across diverse national circumstances.  The framework for MRV that emerged from COP in Copenhagen and COP 16 in Cancun provided for  differentiation between developed and developing  countries – “international assessment and review”  for developed countries and “international consultation  and analysis” for developing countries (UNFCCC  2009; UNFCCC 2010). While this differentiated  approach addressed the different capabilities and  national circumstances of developing and developed  countries, it has not yet achieved a more robust common  transparency and MRV framework. A stepwise  approach to implementing a common framework for  all countries is needed, so that developing countries   with greater capabilities adopt these standards  earliest. Successful implementation will also depend  on enhancing the capacity of developing countries,  particularly their governance systems, so that they  are able to effectively participate in MRV.  Meanwhile, greater transparency regarding emissions  and finance can enable increased participation  and engagement in climate policy by civil  society and the private sector, thereby building a  country’s overall capabilities and strengthening  its ability to undertake greater climate action. For  example, calls for transparency about fossil-fuel  subsidies have partially been driven by the idea that  awareness will generate interest and political support  for subsidy reform (Victor 2009b).  Effective transparency systems can be important for  designing, implementing, and evaluating climate  policies that protect or enhance capabilities. If  properly directed and resourced, measurement  and reporting can address the effects of climate  policies on the capabilities of vulnerable or poor  populations, including the benefits of well-designed  policies. Capabilities should be included in the  suite of metrics countries are encouraged to track  and report on. Over time, measuring and tracking  the relationships between climate policies and  the enhancement of specific capabilities will yield  important insights about what actually improved  well-being and what does not. Including capabilities  in the suite of metrics routinely gathered may  require additional support for countries with  limited governance capacity.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should create a stepwise  approach leading to a common MRV framework,  with developing countries with the greatest  capabilities adopting the standards first.  ▪▪Support should be provided to developing  countries to build their national capabilities  and adopt a common framework for MRV.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should provide guidance  and ensure support so that developing countries  monitor and report on the ways in which  climate policies have affected the capabilities of  the most vulnerable and least well off.  ▪▪The agreement should also encourage public  access to and dissemination of information,  as well as support to enable that provision of  information (Dominican Republic et al. 2014.)  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up ▪▪The agreement should also encourage countries  to report on current policy environments,  especially on their levels of fossil-fuel subsidies.  Countries can identify prospective ways to  reform those policies that would both achieve  climate objectives and build capabilities, while  they can also seek support for implementation  of those reforms.  Set an Equitable Long-Term Mitigation Goal  While intended NDCs provide an essential mechanism  for making mitigation commitments in the  2015 Agreement, they do not create a long-term  objective for the emissions reductions required for  achieving equity. Some countries have proposed  that the 2015 Agreement include a collective longterm  trajectory for emissions reductions or specific  mitigation actions (UNFCCC 2014b). To be successful,  a long-term goal needs to address capabilities  and equity concerns.  Expressing such a goal as a mitigation objective,  and not only as a temperature threshold, can help  countries identify specific policies and investments  that will contribute to sufficient climate action and  enable countries to ensure that transformation will  have benefits for capabilities. For example, the 2015  Agreement could incorporate a collective global trajectory  for emissions reduction or specific mitigation  actions capable of achieving the level of emission  reductions needed for climate stabilization, such as  phasing out GHG emissions or shifting to predominantly  renewable energy in the second half of the  century (Box 42). Using a capabilities lens to inform  such a goal would require a focus on policies that  can also build capabilities, such as using renewable  energy to increase access to electricity.  In setting such a goal, there must also be a recognition  that countries with differing capabilities  may have to proceed at different paces. A phased  approach would allow countries to take action at  different dates based on their capabilities, while  investment and technology development, cooperation,  and transfer would be essential to enabling  their action. Finance and other support, including  capacity building, will also be needed to help  countries with lower capabilities protect or enhance  the opportunities of those who are least well off and  may be affected by these policies.  To ensure that a long-term mitigation goal takes  into account the capabilities of those who are most  vulnerable or least well off, this long-term goal  should include:  ▪▪A phased approach so that countries would set  a date for phasing out GHG emissions or phasing  in predominantly renewable energy based  on their level of national capabilities.  As the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) report shows, keeping global temperature  rise below 2oC means that only a limited amount of total  greenhouse gases can be emitted into the atmosphere.  The total amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted  is approximately 1,000 PgC, and between 1870 and  2011 the world had already emitted 515 PgC (Collins et  al. 2014). The reality of this carbon budget means that  countries must take action that will substantially reduce  emissions below that total level to avoid catastrophic  climate change.  Many proposals have been made for how the carbon  budget might be divided equitably among countries  in order to set country-specific emissions reduction  objectives. While it is clearly essential to recognize the  overall limits on emissions and to assess who should  undertake what levels and types of emissions reductions,  avoiding catastrophic climate change can also be framed  in terms of the low-carbon transformations that are  needed to achieve adequate mitigation. Doing so can  focus attention on the role of those transformational  actions in building capabilities.  For example, the IPCC has suggested that staying below  2oC requires a substantial increase in low-carbon energy  supplies. Low-carbon energy, which currently accounts  for 30 percent of electricity production, would have to  increase to more than 80 percent by 2050 (Bruckner et  al. 2014). Achieving this level of low-carbon energy can  be undertaken largely through widespread deployment  of renewable energy, which can also provide significant  equity and capability benefits.  Focusing the question of climate action on the mitigation  actions can help concentrate attention on the capabilities  that such actions build and how they can be built.  BOX 42 | CARBON BUDGETS AND  MITIGATION ACTIONS   ▪▪Increased emphasis on technology development,  cooperation, deployment, and transfer so  that countries with limited capabilities would  be able to take on these goals and benefit from  increased capabilities through the deployment  of new technologies.  ▪▪Support for countries with lower capabilities to  conduct vulnerability assessments and identify  specific strategies to avoid unintended consequences  of rapid mitigation transitions.  Cycles of Climate Actions Build Capabilities  There is increasing support among the Parties in  the UNFCCC that a set of cycles of action should  be included in the 2015 Agreement. These cycles  would facilitate a process of increasing ambition at  regular intervals over time (such as every five years)  (UNFCCC 2014b). As emphasized throughout this  report, the effects of climate change are already  growing, and actions taken to date will not prove  adequate to keeping temperature rise below the 2oC  threshold agreed at COP 16 in Cancun (IPCC 2013;  UNEP 2013). From an equity perspective, the 2015  Agreement must establish a foundation for deeper  action on all fronts to protect capabilities for current  and future generations.  To meet these challenges in the long-term, the  2015 Agreement must not only provide a clear  and binding process for increasing ambition, but  a mechanism for reviewing and assessing action  across all its elements (Morgan, Dagnet, and Tirpak  2014). The agreement should provide for global  assessments of progress to date and action needed  to strengthen the multiple dimensions of climate  action that affect capabilities: mitigation, adaptation,  and support (including finance, technology,  and capacity building). In addition to assessing  progress at the aggregate level, these cycles should  include assessments of countries’ actions to date,  their future needs and opportunities for specific  mitigation and adaptation actions, and their  required levels of support to undertake that action.  A specific technical process within the UNFCCC,  such as within the Subsidiary Body on Scientific  and Technical Advice (SBSTA) or a technical panel,  should be established to agree on equity criteria  that can be used to assess proposed national contributions  after 2015. These criteria should include  the national capabilities indicators proposed in this  report, but could also include other indicators, such  as responsibility metrics. This process to agree on  criteria would need to be concluded several years  before the next cycle of commitments commences;  if the cycles are in five year intervals, that process  would need to conclude by 2017 or 2018.  The indicators used to assess national capabilities  (see Tables 3 and 7) could further strengthen this  review process by evaluating countries’ national  capabilities, the impacts of climate change on  capabilities, and the implications of climate action  for those capabilities. Repeatedly returning to  these core indicators will facilitate the evaluation  of progress over time, ensure that contributions are  dynamic and reflect changes in national capabilities,  and maintain pressure to consistently increase  ambition until levels that ensure climate stabilization  and human well-being are reached.  Moreover, to inform the design and implementation  of policies that actively contribute to well-being,  each of the review cycles must include an analysis of  what has actually been accomplished. Again, drawing  on insights from Chapters 2 and 3, specific mitigation  and adaptation policies should be assessed  with an eye to their effect on actual capabilities.  Best practices that facilitate greater well-being,  especially of those who are most vulnerable or least  well off should be particularly supported.  As noted elsewhere in this report, measuring and  tracking vulnerabilities and capabilities is important  for both mitigation and adaptation policies.  Ensuring that a review process reflects the effects  on actual well-being during implementation  processes would be greatly facilitated by ongoing  monitoring of policy implications for individuals  and communities targeted by such policies. Including  these assessments in the review process would  facilitate national and international learning about  best practices and opportunities for designing and  implementing climate actions that increase wellbeing  in the long term.  How to sequence and organize these cycles of  review is a key issue. Because the issues of mitigation,  adaptation, and finance are likely to remain  distinct under the 2015 Agreement, conducting  separate, but connected, reviews may be one  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up pragmatic approach. Each issue could be reviewed  in ways that enables it to build on the other issues  and reflects the connections between them. For  example, while mitigation goals may be best  addressed within a distinct assessment, adaptation  and finance needs are intimately connected to  mitigation progress and cannot be identified until  emission trajectories are clarified. Working through  these issues in an iterative manner through the  review cycles would allow each to be informed by  action in the other areas.  Achieving Equity in the 2015 Agreement  from a Capabilities Perspective  This report has presented specific strategies that  can be used to enhance equity and capabilities  through climate action at the national level, along  with the ways in which international action can  support those approaches. The 2015 Agreement  can facilitate these strategies and policies and  enable climate action and equity to go hand in  hand. Achieving success will depend on recognizing  and addressing the central role of capabilities—  ensuring that adequate mitigation and adaptation  are undertaken with capabilities at the core, providing  adequate finance aimed at building capabilities,  and integrating equity and capabilities into  areas such as transparency and accountability and  technology. This will enable the 2015 Agreement  to support and facilitate capabilities at the national  level across a range of climate policy areas and  provide a new model for equity, one that can move  past debates to success.  The new international  climate agreement can  facilitate strategies and  policies that enable  climate action and equity  to go hand in hand.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up CAPABILITIES AND  LONG-TERM CLIMATE  TRANSFORMATION  As climate impacts continue to increase, a new perspective and  narrative that promotes equity in the context of climate change is  needed. The capabilities approach provides a framework to formulate  national climate policies and strategies that build the capabilities  of individuals, communities, and nations. This approach can link  national level efforts to international level commitments to generate  the momentum and long-term commitment necessary to shift  economies to low-carbon pathways and achieve human well-being.   for this approach, since any attempt at creating an  international regime to combat climate change and  keep global warming within certain limits requires  ways to compare countries and the actions they take.  But this approach can also miss the ways in which  well-designed climate action affects—and can  benefit—the lives of people. Attention to capabilities  will help maintain a focus on the need to  consistently ensure climate policy itself enhances  and improves human well-being and builds toward  transformational action at a global scale.  A new narrative for equity is needed that can  help move us toward stronger climate action. By  focusing on the concrete opportunities and benefits  that climate action is able to provide, this narrative  can enable the fundamental transformation that  will improve peoples’ lives and meet the global  challenge posed by climate change.  As we move toward a world of unavoidable climate  impacts, the need for transformational climate  policy has become increasingly apparent. Shifting  economies to low-carbon pathways and building  the long-term resilience of communities are essential  challenges. Addressing these challenges in an  equitable way presents the international community  with an even greater challenge, but one that is  needed to build the necessary consensus for action.  The capabilities approach can provide a much  needed new perspective and narrative for building  equitable climate action. A focus on capabilities  enables progress to be evaluated in terms of  the concrete effects of climate policy on human  well-being. These effects can encourage proactive  approaches to policymaking that emphasize the  tangible benefits of taking action—a key factor in  mobilizing and achieving long-term transformation.  Figure 2 illustrates how the capabilities approach can  provide a pathway to support and accelerate the goal of  climate policy transformation. The figure underscores  the ways in which capabilities are relevant at multiple  levels and can build from one to the next—from individuals  and communities to nations to the globe.  The lowest level of the diagram reflects the equity  challenge currently presented by the unequal capabilities  of individuals, communities, and nations.  To address this challenge, the first level of action  focuses on the importance of committing to climate  action that also builds the capabilities of individuals  and communities. As highlighted in Chapters 2 and  3, this approach is essential to developing equitable  policy, but alone it is unlikely to move us toward  transformational goals.  The next level in the figure focuses on the broader,  more systemic aspects of capabilities at the national  level. Strengthening the capabilities of individuals  and communities can provide a foundation for  building the key capabilities of countries, which  can be enhanced through effective climate policies.  Finally, at the highest level in the figure, the capabilities  approach builds on action at the community  and national levels to generate the momentum  needed for achieving low-carbon and climate-resilient  transformation at a global scale.  Until now, the equity debate at the international  level has relied on abstract frameworks concerning  the roles played by nations. There are good reasons  .
