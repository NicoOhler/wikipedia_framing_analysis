UN links hunger with climate change

Ban Ki-Moon in summit warningSearch for coherent response to problem

The world cannot achieve food security without first tackling global warming, the United Nations secretary-general said yesterday, warning that failure at next month's international climate change negotiations would result in a further rise in hunger.

The warning by Ban Ki-Moon at the start of a three-day UN world food summit in Rome came one day after Barack Obama, US president, backed European and UN views that the Copenhagen summit would not produce a legally binding agreement to tackle global warming.

"There cannot be food security without climate security," Mr Ban said. "Today's event is critical," he added, referring to the food summit, "so is Copenhagen".

His comments signal how leaders are grappling with the need to respond coherently - and simultaneously - to energy, food and climate challenges . "The three are key for political security and stability," said Alexander Muller, assistant director-general at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Jim Fitzpatrick, UK minister for food, farming and environment, told the Financial Times that food and climate security were "two sides of the same coin".

The summit was convened in response to last year's food crisis, which saw record prices for staples, food riots in about 30 countries and pushed the number of chronically hungry people above 1bn for the first time.

The summit's declaration, approved yesterday, reflects that sentiment. "Climate change poses additional severe risk to food security and the agriculture sector," it said. But the declaration was short on targets and timeframes, non-governmental organisations cautioned.
