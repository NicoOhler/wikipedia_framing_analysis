We support EU targets on climate change action

From Mr Clement B. Booth and others.

Sir, As members of the EU Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change (the EU CLG) we feel we must point out that not all industrial leaders are critical of the European Union's targets to cut carbon emissions by 20 per cent, generate 20 per cent of energy from renewables and improve energy efficiency by 20 per cent by 2020 ("Sarkozy given emissions challenge", February 27).

We believe the benefits of strong, early action on climate change outweigh the costs of not acting, and we support these targets. Furthermore, just last month, the group offered its support for the European Commission's climate and energy package of policy proposals. We congratulate Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso's leadership on this issue and we welcome the determination already shown by Nicolas Sarkozy to secure an agreement on this package during the French presidency of the EU.

Our vision is for the EU to meet its 2020 targets in a way that provides long-term economic and competitive benefits for European business. In doing so, the EU will demonstrate to the world that tackling climate change is the pro-growth strategy.
