Climate change interventions are long-term investments

From Mr Tom Delay.

Sir, Ofgem's findings that government interventions to reduce carbon and expand the renewable industry are increasing electricity prices is fully consistent with the fact that historically the true cost of carbon has not been effectively priced ("Green policies push up energy prices", January 16). However, the analysis misses the big picture.

The Stern review on the economics of climate change made clear a year ago that interventions such as the European Union emission trading scheme and the UK's renewables obligation should be viewed, not as short-term costs, but as long-term investments essential to deliver a low-carbon economy. Failure to invest in these and other measures that deliver deep cuts in carbon while also catalysing new low-carbon technologies will cost us much more in the long term.
