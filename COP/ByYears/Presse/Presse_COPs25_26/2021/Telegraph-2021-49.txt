Military must help combat climate change, says Nato chief

By Danielle Sheridan Defence corresponDent

THE military must cut its emissions, the head of Nato has said, as he tried to woo the United States on
climate change.

Jens Stoltenberg, who yesterday morning met with John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate, in Brussels,
tweeted that the two "agree that climate change makes the world more unsafe".

He went on to suggest that Nato "needs to step up and play a bigger role in combating it - including by
reducing military emissions".

The   UK,   one   of   the   military   alliance's   30   members,   has   committed   to   meeting   the   legally   binding
commitment to get to net zero by 2050.

As part of this target the Ministry of Defence is required to meet the Government's sustainability objectives.

The department's Climate Change and Sustainability Review, led by Lt Gen Richard Nugee, will be published
in the coming weeks.

In 2019, Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the head of the Army, pledged that the army would undergo a green
revolution.

As a result, hybrid armoured 4x4s have been tested for the ﬁrst time.

Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, announced in December last year that algae, alcohol and household
waste would power RAF ﬁghter jets to cut carbon emissions.

The British Army Training Support Unit Belize and the Defence Infrastructure Organisation have also collabo
rated with the conservation charity Panthera to protect endangered jungle wildlife by ensuring essential
military training does not disturb local habitats.

It is understood, meanwhile, that the MoD has invested in renewable energy on several defence sites.

An MoD spokesman said: "We are committed to offering a greener culture in defence while maintaining
critical outputs and capabilities."
