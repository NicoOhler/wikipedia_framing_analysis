Climate change is blamed for record number of storms
By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

THE current Atlantic hurricane season has broken the record for the highest number of named storms.

Storm Theta, which formed over night on Monday, brought the 2020 season to 29 storms, breaking the record of 27 named storms set in 2005.

As well as Theta, which is not forecast to make landfall, storm Eta is also active, hitting Florida earlier this week after leaving around 200 people dead or missing in Central America.

It is unusual to have two storms active at the same time this late in the year, and this is the first time this has happened since 1932.

Scientists said the active season had been fuelled by man-made global warming as well as La Niña, the natural weather event which creates favourable conditions for hurricanes.

Prof Michael Mann, director of the earth system science centre at Pennsylvania State University, said the total outstripped his pre-season forecast of 24.

"As we continue to warm the planet and the tropical Atlantic, there is more energy to fuel more and stronger tropical storms and hurricanes.

"When we get a La Niña event, as with this year, it reinforces the impact that climate change is having and we get the sorts of devastating storm seasons that we are witnessing," he said.

Storms are typically named from the Latin alphabet but this year scientists had to begin using the Greek alphabet after running out of letters for only the second time in history.
