Seattle's new NHL home will be called Climate Pledge Arena    home/3259008001  Steve Gardner | USA TODAY  The Seattle NHL expansion team entering the league two seasons from now will play its home games at Climate Pledge Arena.   Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced Thursday his company has purchased the naming rights and has selected the name to serve as "a regular reminder of the urgent need for climate action."  The plan to refurbish the former Key Arena aims to make it the first zero-carbon arena in the world, powered exclusively by renewable energy. Bezos says it will "generate zero waste from operations and events, and use unclaimed rainwater in the ice system to create the greenest ice in the NHL."  "Our goal is to make sure every visit to this arena will be enjoyable and memorable, and sustainability is a large part of that," said Tim Leiweke, CEO of Oak View Group and leader of the arena project. "It is our time to step up to face the challenge of our generation. We must take steps to build arenas and stadiums that front-and-center align with our zero-carbon mission statement."  Construction of the arena, which will be 100% powered by on-site solar panels and offsite solar farms, has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but is expected to be completed in plenty of time for the start of the 2021-22 NHL season.
