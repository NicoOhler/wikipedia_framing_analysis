 I Am Greta puppyish portrait of the climate change activist  Danny Leigh  How do you solve a problem  like I Am Greta ? Do we review the fearless young woman at its centre, climate change activist Greta Thunberg, resolved to battle the crisis still looming on the other side of the pandemic? Or the actual documentary itself, advertorially polite, slickly inessential? Director Nathan Grossman arrived at the project early, a friend of the family who captured Thunberg's first protests, the solo school strikes that quickly drew the attention of the world. But from there the film just tags along, blank and puppyish.  Mere proximity brings insights, of course: the sheer self-possession of the teenager compelled to act by the same scale of disaster that shrinks so many of us into inertia; the trial of her Asperger's, more of an anguish than has been revealed before; the grim glimpses of political leaders at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit in New York. (We are doomed, you conclude.) But the film is plain adulatory even as Thunberg begs us to panic, it assures us we can just let her keep doing it on our behalf. Like the rest of her generation, she deserves better.
