Telegraph (London, UK) Thursday, June 10, 2010HOT WEATHER WAS THE MAKING OF MANDaily Telegraph ReporterWE enjoy hot weather because mankind evolved in average daily temperatures of up to 95F (35C), research suggests.For the first time, scientists have estimated accurately the climate during the development of the earliest humans in the Turkana Basin in Kenya four million years ago. The basin is nicknamed the cradle of evolution and fossil evidence suggests it is the birthplace of mankind.It has been possible to work out rainfall and the kind of plants that existed during this time but until now it has been much harder to measure the temperature accurately.Scientists discovered that average daily temperatures have remained around the mid-90sF in the basin, avoiding the global cooling due to the Ice Age.The discovery backs up a theory called "thermal hypothesis" which claims that the high temperatures led to the evolution of mankind. Humans began walking upright, as the air a few feet above the surface of the earth is not so hot, shedding fur and sweating as they did so to cool down.Scientists used a new system examining isotopes, a kind of atom, embedded in layers of soil going back millions of years.The isotopes they found suggested constant temperatures in a range between 85 and 95F (29 to 35C).The research has been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.Benjamin Passey, who led the study, said: "This region, which is one of the key places where fossils have been found documenting human evolution, has been a really hot place for a really long time, even during the period between three million years ago and now when the ice ages began and the global climate became cooler."Now we have evidence that it was hot. Thus, we can say that the thermal hypothesis is credible."95F The temperature in which humans evolved in Kenya four million years ago
