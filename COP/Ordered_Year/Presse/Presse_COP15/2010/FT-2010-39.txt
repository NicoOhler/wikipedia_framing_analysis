Climate is just one aspect of our work

From Ms Diane Carol Bast.

Sir, Fiona Harvey ("E-mail leaks that clouded climate issue", March 9) writes: "There are also a few well-funded sceptic groups, such as the US-based Heartland Institute, supported to the tune of $5.2m in 2007, the latest year for which figures are available."

That implies the Heartland Institute received $5.2m in 2007 for its work on climate change, which is not true. Heartland addresses a wide range of issues, including budget and tax policy, education and environment issues in addition to climate change, healthcare, information technology, and more. Climate change is one part of a large and diversified policy portfolio.

Moreover, to say 2007 is the latest year for which Heartland's funding figures are available is incorrect. The Heartland Institute's 2009 annual report, summarising receipts and expenses for 2008, is readily available at www.heartland.org/about.
