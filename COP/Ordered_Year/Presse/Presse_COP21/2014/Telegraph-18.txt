The Daily Telegraph (London, UK) Monday, November 3, 2014, p. 23Changing planetTHE DAILY TELEGRAPH Established 1855The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) yesterday released its first "Synthesis Report" since 2007, and it made for typically grim reading. Global warming is set to inflict "severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts" on both humanity and the natural world. Carbon emissions must be cut sharply and swiftly, ultimately to zero. Fossil fuels should be phased out by the end of the century.Climate change is undoubtedly a serious problem. Yet the difficulty the IPCC faces, in convincing us to tackle it, is that it has hardly covered itself with glory before. Its reports are the result of endless wrangling between experts and governments, resulting in an uneasy fusion of spin and science. Its previous work has contained glaring errors – such as the hyperbolic prediction of vanishing Himalayan glaciers. And previous efforts by governments to take action, especially Ed Miliband's Climate Change Act, have had unforeseen and damaging consequences, not least raising electricity prices and imposing huge extra burdens on industry and consumers.Too often, the green movement has been synonymous with a Left–wing mentality that sees progress as a bad thing – that looks at the millions of Chinese moving up the income scale, or Africans getting access to heating and electricity, and sees only the environmental cost. But in fact, the most encouraging statistic in the IPCC's report has nothing to do with the climate. It is that over the same century in which the challenge of global warming will be confronted, global GDP is expected to treble. A richer world is not a curse, but a blessing – especially since it will be able to invest in the kind of technological innovation that minimises carbon emissions without damaging growth.
