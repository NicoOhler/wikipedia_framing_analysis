Offer of deal for climate talks
By Joshua Chaffin in Brussels

The European Union's environment chief challenged developing countries on Thursday to agree at the Copenhagen climate summit in December to rein in their emissions growth in return for greater financial aid.

Stavros Dimas, the environment commissioner, set out the conditions as he unveiled the European Commission's long-awaited financing proposal, under which the EU would contribute anywhere from €2bn ($3bn, £1.7bn) to €15bn per year to developing countries, including China, India and South Africa.

"This cannot be a blank cheque," said Mr Dimas. "The level of funding will depend on how ambitious the Copenhagen agreement turns out to be."

Mr Dimas also urged the US and other wealthy countries to suggest proposals of their own. "As I have said before: no money from developed nations - no deal in Copenhagen."

The Commission is hoping that its proposal will unblock discussions that have become bogged down over the question of how much money wealthy nations should offer to poorer ones to help them limit greenhouse-gas emissions and deal with the effects of climate change.

The Commission's proposal, which will be discussed at next week's meeting of European heads of state, pegs developed nations' needs at €100bn per year from 2020.

It envisages EU governments contributing up to 30 per cent of an international fund that would range from €22bn to €50bn.

The Commission suggested that the EU could pay with revenues from its emissions trading system. It also predicted that €38bn in private-sector funds could flow to the developing world each year through "robust" carbon markets, which encourage companies to invest in green technologies in poorer countries.

"The more the carbon market can provide, the less demand there will be on public finance," the proposal states.
