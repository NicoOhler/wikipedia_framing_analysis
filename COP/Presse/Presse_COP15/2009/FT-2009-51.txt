US envoy rules out climate deal with Beijing
By Geoff Dyer in Beijing and Bill Savadove in Shanghai

China and the US will not sign a landmark agreement on climate change policies when Barack Obama visits Beijing next month, the US president's climate change envoy said yesterday, in spite of high hopes this year among US officials, write Geoff Dyer in Beijing and Bill Savadove in Shanghai .

Todd Stern said the two would seek "a common understanding" on climate change ahead of a crucial meeting in Copenhagen in December and would deepen co-operation on clean energy, but would not reach an accord on carbon emissions targets.

The low expectations for the talks might please some European nations, which feared that China and the US would seek to impose a bilateral accord on other countries. But the fact that no landmark deal will be agreed underlines the weak position of the US in climate change discussions until cap-and-trade legislation is passed by Congress.

"I do not think that we are expecting a broad agreement, per se," Mr Stern saidin Shanghai. "It's not an issue of trying to cut some separate deal, but there absolutely is an issue of trying to get us and China as aligned as possible so that we have a chance to get an agreement in Copenhagen."

As the two biggest emitters of carbon, the US and China are central to an eventual new international agreement on global warming. The discussions during Mr Obama's visit could be pivotal to the debate, potentially setting the tone for the conference.

US officials had high expectations about what they could achieve through bilateral talks with China, hoping to use a broad discussion on environmental issues to nudge China into setting a date for when its carbon emissions will peak.

But Congress has yet to approve climate change legislation, significantly reducing any leverage the US might have had.
