Transport hinders EU climate policy
By ANDREW BOUNDS

Europe cannot win the fight against climate change unless it ends its love affair with cars and planes, a top European Union agency warned yesterday.

The European Environment Agency said that the EU would have hit its Kyoto protocol target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 8 per cent between 1990 and 2012 years ago had it not been for the fast increase from transport. All other sectors of the economy cut emissions between 1990 and 2005, its report said, while transport grew 26 per cent.

"Transport has been a free-rider for too long when it comes to the fight against global warming and carbon emissions," said Jacqueline McGlade, chief executive of the agency.

She said investment was still skewed towards roads and airports rather than rail and sea.
