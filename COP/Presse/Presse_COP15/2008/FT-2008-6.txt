Oil chief fears climate inaction

The US risks a loss of geopolitical influence if it continues to oppose the growing worldwide desire to take action on climate change, Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, told energy executives yesterday.

Mr Mulva, a keynote speaker at this year's Cambridge Energy Research Associates conference, said such stonewalling would cause "incalculable damage" to efforts to fight terrorism and encourage trade.

"The US has missed opportunities to show leadership because it lacks a coherent approach," he said, noting that any national policy may be 1-2 years off, although individual US states are taking action on their own.

If the "prevailing confusion" continued, said Abdallah Jum'ah, president and chief executive of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, there was a risk that necessary expansion of energy supplies would be compromised. "The world community needs to reach a consensus on this issue.''

Mr Mulva said climate change concerns were likely to constrain the ability to provide sustainable energy.
