Expansion of Paris airport scrapped over climate fears

By Our Foreign Staff

FRANCE has announced it is cancelling the planned expansion of Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on
environmental grounds.

Barbara   Pompili,   the   environment   minister,   said   that   building   a   fourth   terminal   to   boost   the   airport's
capacity by 40million passengers per year was "obsolete" and not in keeping with efforts to ﬁght global
warming.

The government has asked airport operator ADP to scrap the current project "and present a new one, more
consistent with its objectives concerning climate change and the protection of the environment".

ADP said the move was "one of the outcomes of the Covid-19 crisis" and said it would now begin "a period of
reﬂection" about the airport's future.

The decision to disband the project, which was expected to cost at least €7billion (£6billion), comes a week
after a French court ruled the government had failed to take sufﬁcient measures to halt climate change.

The plan to extend Europe's second biggest airport had already run into resistance from environmentalists.
