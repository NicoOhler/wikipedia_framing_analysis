Resist alarmist and costly reactions on climate

Letters

Paul Massara's plea for a Marshall Plan for Climate Change (Letters, March 13) needs to be assessed on the basis of evidence, given the volume of public funds which would be spent for uncertain gains. There is no guarantee that a splurge of funds into preventive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would hold-off sea level rises indefinitely. In any case, if the geological record is anything to go by, such sea level changes would occur only gradually.

For instance, the inundation of the island of Doggerland in the North Sea, at the end of the last Ice Age around 8,000 years ago, is estimated to have taken place over a period of about 300 years, providing the settlers of the region time to migrate to upland areas. Save for an asteroid hitting the Earth, there is nso suggestion sea level rises will exceed this scale of change.

I often wonder if, in the climate change debate, there is a missing sense of the proportion of timescales, and that a one-directional "we must do something!" approach leads decision makers and the public towards taking initiatives which may provide little-tono economic return in the long run. Alarmist, knee-jerk responses — which involve vast demands on public funds — must be resisted. We have been here before with nuclear power; with the tax incentives for the sale of diesel cars.

Take stock, listen to opinions of all shades and acknowledge that no one possesses a monopoly on wisdom. Oliver Lewis Montgomery, Powys, UK
