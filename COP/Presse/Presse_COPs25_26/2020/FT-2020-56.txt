Reaction to outbreak can't ignore climate change

Letters

In his column on the urgent need for co-ordinated economic policy responses to the coronavirus threat, Wolfgang MÃ¼nchau criticises European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde for talking too much about green finance and climate change, and wonders whether this has become too much of a distraction from what he considers the more urgent task at hand. ("The eurozone is too complacent about the coronavirus threat", March 9.) As much as I agree with his point that we need urgent policy responses to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus, the notion that climate change is something we can deal with another time is utterly wrong. Indeed, any crisis responses, be they fiscal or monetary, should be judged on their sustainability impact.

All countercyclical policy measures should be either carbon neutral or carbon negative. We have already missed the opportunity to implement sustainable crisis responses during the 2008-09 crisis. We should not waste another crisis.
