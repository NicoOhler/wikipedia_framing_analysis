Climate change may wipe out UK garden birds by 2100
By Helena Horton

BRITAIN'S garden birds could be wiped out in 80 years if climate change continues to accelerate, research from the University of Oxford has warned.

Warmer weather earlier in the year could disrupt the ecosystem balance which keeps small birds which visit our gardens alive. Great tits and similar species rely on large amounts of larvae being born at around the same time in order to feed their young.

They have evolved to breed at the same time so they can keep their chicks alive. But if weather patterns shift, their food sources will come out earlier, and not be as abundant when the birds feed their young. The larvae feed on leaves, and when the temperature rises, the leaves come out earlier, causing the larvae to be produced earlier. While the great tit, below, can evolve to keep up with prey when change is slow, a faster change in temperature could see the birds left behind.

The "breaking point" is estimated to be when larvae and leaves are produced 24 days earlier than currently. If that happens, great tits could be extinct here by 2100, said lead author Prof Emily Simmonds, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology which produced the report with Oxford University. "If the changes happen too fast, species can become extinct," she said. "Great tits won't always be able to keep up with changes in the larvae supply. The good news is that they can survive scenarios with lower or medium warming trends."
