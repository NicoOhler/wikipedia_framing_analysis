No time to waste on tackling
climate change, says PM

By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

THERE is "no time to waste" on climate action, the Prime Minister has warned, as he prepared to unveil a 10-point plan setting out the Government's priorities for the environment.

Boris Johnson called on other governments to disclose their own plans for action, calling climate change "the most enduring threat to the futures of our children and grandchildren".

"There is no greater duty for any nation than protecting our people and our planet," he said.

His comments were made a year ahead of the international COP26 cli mate summit, which was supposed to take place in Glasgow this week, but was delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic. Mr Johnson is expected to lay out the Government's priorities in an announcement within the next week.

The Government has previously announced its goal to reach net zero by 2050, and priorities including investment in wind energy, the protection and restoration of biodiversity, planting trees, and the restoration of peat bogs.

The plan is expected to prioritise the use of new technologies such as hydrogen fuel, nuclear expansion and an earlier date for the phase out of petrol cars, which is currently set at 2035 but is expected to be moved to 2032 or even 2030.

Greenpeace UK said: "Boris Johnson is right to call on world leaders to waste no time in setting out their commit ments to cut carbon emissions, but the Prime Minister's actions will carry far more weight than his words."
