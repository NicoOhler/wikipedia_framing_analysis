CAMPAIGN EVALUATION     FEBRUARY 2016          Disclaimer     This is the report of independent evaluators commissioned by action/2015.   The views expressed in this report should not be taken as being the views of   action/2015, its participating organisations or its partners.       summary of key finDings     Overview: Action/2015 was a global coalition that came together united by the belief that 2015 was a   critical year for progress in the fight against climate change, poverty and inequality. Its key mobilisation   moments were around the United Nations (UN) Financing for Development (FDD) Summit in July, the UN   General Assembly (UNGA) in September and the UN Climate Change Conference (also known as COP21)   in December. The campaigns three key objectives were to 1) increase public awareness of the risks and   opportunities of 2015, 2) inspire the public to take action and 3) build a stronger civil society movement.   This evaluation finds that the campaign was most successful in achieving its third objective, and relatively   successful in reaching its first and second objectives.     Engagement and objectives: Engagement with the campaign among participating organisations was   high and of a positive nature. The campaigns key objectives were well understood and supported by   participating organisations and others that were involved with the campaign. Understanding of the   campaign model was lower, especially on responsibilities at a national level and among those further away   from its central governance structure. The campaign included a wide variety of actors on a global, national   and local level, many of whom had existing networks and supporter bases, and with varying experience of   campaigning methods.     Campaign design, structure and messaging: The overall design of the campaign and the use of the   flotilla structure were fit for purpose, given the objectives of the campaign focused on public mobilisation.   Its opt-in structure inspired enthusiasm and creativity. The campaign structure could have been more   effective with increasingly localised messaging, improved regional coordination and central campaigning   capacity around fundraising and communications at a global level.     Campaign delivery and coordination: The global coordination of action/2015 was effective. Delivery of   the campaign was strongly dependent on national participating organisations capabilities. Action/2015   funding enabled participation but was often insufficient. Many participating organisations brought   additional funding to the campaign outside of the central budget, mostly through contributing own   resources (some of them in-kind contributions), some through additional funds for mobilisation activities.   The multitude of mobilisation events and campaign moments resulted in high engagement but also in   some campaign fatigue and logistical challenges.     Impact on raising awareness and mobilising the public: Raising awareness of the risks and opportunities   of 2015 and mobilising the public was relatively successful. Large numbers of participating organisations   and citizens were mobilised around key moments. Traditional and social media played an important role in   awareness of the campaign.     Impact on building stronger civil society movement: The most important outcome of the campaign   was building a stronger global civil society movement, creating stronger networks between civil society   organisations (CSOs) and increasing skills of local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). This is the most   valuable outcome of action/2015 to protect in the future.     Impact on policy making: For many who took part in the campaign, the absence of influencing decision   makers as a key objective was a major weakness of action/2015. It is clear that a campaign of the scope and   breadth of action/2015 faced trade-offs and the focus on mobilisation was a deliberate characteristic and   reason for the campaigns success. Although it was not a key objective of the campaign, action/2015 did   have some influence on policy makers, mostly on a global and local level.     Future: There is no clear follow-up strategy for the campaign, and there is a risk that the momentum and   relationships built during the year will not be utilised optimally. The level of enthusiasm for continued   cooperation among participating organisations is very high. There is consensus that the action/2015 brand   and campaign should not be extended, but diverging ideas on possible future directions.          conclusions     In many ways, action/2015 was a transitional campaign. It can be seen as both the last of an old   generation of global campaigns and the first of a new generation. It looked to the future in being strongly   rooted in the Global South. It was collaborative, inclusive and owned by its participating organisations, but   was still initiated and funded by Northern groups.     The campaign met the expectations of participating organisations. It showed that with a limited   amount of central funding it is possible to meaningfully inspire civil society across the world.     The key impact of the campaign was that global civil society groups learned how to work together.     Action/2015 laid the groundwork for long-term impact, especially in terms of connecting national   agendas and government policy to global frameworks, and inspiring a new generation of activists. It   demonstrated there is real public constituency for the SDGs.     Action/2015 took meaningful steps towards Southern ownership of a global campaign. It also created   a space for climate and development groups to work together.     Overall, design and structure of the campaign were fit for purpose. The campaign showed benefits of   leveraging resources through partnerships, networks and coalitions and of campaigning under one global   brand. The most important feedback on campaign design was that it needed greater localisation, but to   some extent this reflected local capacity to adapt global resources. Participating organisations tested new   tools and approaches to engage communities.     Globally, the campaign did not engage with non-NGO civil society actors, such as faith groups and   trades union, as successfully as it could have done.     recommenDations for members of the action/2015 coalition     1. Members of action/2015 should keep the network alive. It has created a platform for   organisations to collaborate, rather than a single global movement of individual citizens. It has   created real local mobilisation capacity in new places. There needs to be infrastructure for on-going   knowledge sharing, coordination and planning, carrying forward the objectives and Southern led   ownership of the campaign and building on the enthusiasm to work together.   2. Members of action/2015 should identify and plan for moments to come together as a global   network. These could have a thematic focus or could be linked to key mobilisation moments from   the 2015 campaigning year. These moments should have a forward calendar where key moments   will be identified. The coalition needs to think about how these moments will be resourced and   coordinated.   3. Campaigners should consider how they will hold their governments to account. National   governments made real commitments in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris. Members of the   coalition should connect national policy and performance to these commitments, and consider   them in a local context. This will require a focus on policy monitoring and evaluation, gathering   data on implementation and moments to hold governments to account.   4. The coalition should keep building an inclusive network. It should explore broadening the   network to include those civil society actors that were not part of the original campaign, and invest   in existing relationships between participating organisations.        recommenDations for future global campaigns     1. Global campaigns should focus on mobilisation over policy when the objective is   demonstrating broad public pressure for political change. It is an inclusive approach that   requires wide participation and high-level messaging. The trade offs are accountability, specificity   and a limited call to action. The decentralised flotilla is an appropriate model for certain types of   campaigning. It may prove challenging for this model to accommodate more detailed policy and   advocacy work without creative thinking about new approaches.   2. Global campaigns in the future will be most effective when they can connect across issues,   and empower new voices. They must be led by a diverse set of actors rooted in the Global South.   Action/2015 was transitional in the sense that it marked an important step on this journey. The next   generation of global campaigning should build on its achievements. This implies that NGOs and   their funders need to continue to reflect on their fundamental role in society, how they represent   power, their legitimacy and added value.   3. Global campaigns should be as inclusive as possible, and prioritise this early on in the   campaign design. Meaningful coalition building happens when a campaign includes a wide   spectrum of non-NGO civil society actors. There should be more creative thinking about engaging   with other actors such as the private sector, trade unions, faith movements and regional platforms.   The emergence of social enterprises, B Corps, mutual organisations and co-operatives shows that   the line between the private sector and civil society is increasingly opaque.   4. Internally, there may be value in under-promising and over-delivering when planning,   designing and communicating coalitions. It created the space for people in national campaigns   to set their own expectations. This may not always be appropriate for external communications,   but it is an area worth further consideration.   lessons learneD     Decentralise but with central capacity: allow opting-in for partners and participating organisations but   ensure capacity at a global level     The more local the better: use local languages, faces, issues and wording as much as possible to ensure   the campaign links to the local everyday reality     Build on existing structures: leverage the strength of existing networks and relationships. Actively seek     out opportunities to identify and use these networks   Invest in national coalitions: Strong national coalitions can increase impact and reach. Leveraging   networks, a strong coordinator, involving youth and funding are important in building a coalition     Plan, plan, plan and reflect: start planning early and ensure there is time to reflect and learn from past   activities     Consider trade-offs in messaging: consider trade-offs between high level messaging and specific,     targeted messaging, and how this affects the diversity of participants and impact   A united civil society is influential: because it is able to speak with one voice and because between local,   national, regional and global networks it has a tremendous reach     Evaluation is information: monitor and track consistently across countries and use systems for sharing     success stories   Early engagement and wide engagement makes a difference: include a wide variety of actors early on in   the process to design a truly global, inclusive and decentralised campaign     Mobilisation is a means, political change is the end: the ultimate and only way to real change is   influencing policy makers and decision makers, and mobilisation should be in service of this          1. INTROdUCTION TO ThIS EVALUATION   1.1 BackgrounD anD oBjectives   Action/2015 was a global coalition that came together united by the belief that 2015 was a critical year for   progress in the fight against climate change, poverty and inequality.     The key objectives of the coalition were to:     1. Increase public awareness of the opportunities and risks of 2015   2. Inspire the public to take action through mobilisation activities   3. Build a stronger movement of civil society organisations (CSOs)   With key mobilisation activities around the United Nations Financing for Development summit in July, the   UN General Assembly in September, the UN Climate Change Conference in December and other activities   throughout the year, action/2015 completed its agreed schedule of campaigning activity in December.     This evaluation was commissioned in November 2015, with the following key objectives:        Present   a   high   level   overview   of   action/2015,   of what happened during the campaign and   what it comprised of in terms of structure, key mobilisation activities, (social) media presence and   finances     Assess   effectiveness,   efficiency   and   relevance   of   the   campaign in terms of campaign design,   planning, implementation, principles and procedures, capacity and quality of the day-to-day   management of the campaign   Assess   impact   and   outcomes   of   the   campaign   with regards to the key objectives of the   campaign of increasing public awareness, inspiring the public to take action through mobilisation   activities and increasing coordination and cooperation between CSOs, as well as assessing the   campaigns impact on policy making     Synthesise   lessons   learned   and   present   key   recommendations   of the campaign to identify best   practices and inform future CSO coordination mechanisms   1.2 introDuction   This evaluation reviews the design, effectiveness and outcomes of the action/2015 campaign. Following the   Terms of Reference, which are included in the Appendix of this report, it assesses the campaign against its   key objectives. The report consists of the following chapters outlined below.     presents a high-level overview of the campaign, discussing the historical context in   which the campaign was established, its founding meetings and documents, its structure, key   mobilisation moments, key (social) media statistics and the high level financing of the campaign.      Chapter   3   analyses involvement with and perceptions of the campaign. It presents an overview   of stakeholders engagement with the campaign and ambitions and objectives for action/2015. It   considers the campaigns relationship to partners and external actors. It discusses action/2015s   flotilla structure and the actors that were involved with the campaign.      Chapter   4 reviews the design and delivery of the campaign, assessing its effectiveness, efficiency   and relevance. It covers the initial campaign design, structure, cooperation and functioning of   different bodies and how the campaign linked to local contexts. It assesses key themes and the   scope of action/2015 messaging. It also includes an assessment of delivery and coordination of   the campaign, in terms of planning and coordination, execution of mobilisation activities and   campaign resources. Lastly, this chapter will comment on financing and the sub grant system.      INTRODUCTION TO THIS EVALUATION        Chapter   5   assesses the impact and outcomes of the campaign. It considers overall impact,   followed by the campaigns performance against its three key objectives. Chapter 5.3 analyses   impact on increased public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015, public awareness of   the campaign and endorsement of its objectives. Chapter 5.4 discusses impact through inspiring   the public to take action, analysing key mobilisation events and activities. Chapter 5.5 analyses   impact on action/2015s third objective of building a stronger civil society movement. It discusses   how action/2015 created a space for civil society to work together, and how it increased local skills   and capacity. Lastly, Chapter 5.6 examines the extent to which action/2015 had any impact on   influencing policy and decision-makers, and whether this should have been a stronger focus.      Chapter   6 is concerned with the future and follow-up to action/2015, discussing stakeholders   views on next steps now the campaigns activities have formally come to an end and how it   planned and could have prepared for the future.      Chapter   7   consists of conclusions, recommendations and lessons learned both for the participants   in the coalition, and for those who seek to mobilise similar coalitions in the future.   1.3 approach   This evaluation of the action/2015 campaign comprised of a series of activities to evaluate the outcomes   and effectiveness of the campaign, namely:        A   review   of   action/2015   documentation   and   data      Qualitative   interviews   with   36 stakeholders from the different action/2015 governing bodies,   participating organisations and external organisations      A   quantitative   survey   completed   by   160 respondents, directed at participating organisations but   open to anyone who was involved with action/2015   A detailed description of the approach for this evaluation, including information on the documentation and   data that was analysed can be found in the Appendix (Chapter 8.2). It includes details on the reach and sample   of stakeholders for the qualitative interviews and the quantitative survey. The Appendix also includes a   section on comments and limitations on the process.          2   2.1 introDuction   This chapter presents a high level overview of the features of the action/2015 campaign, the context that it   was developed in, its key mobilisation moments, media profile and financing. All graphs and charts in this   chapter are based on information provided by the coalition.     2.2 context   A number of civil society groups and partners identified the year 2015 as a potentially important year for   global campaigning.     The primary reason was that 2015 marked the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and   the launch of their successor framework, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, the United   Nations Climate Change Conference took place in November/December 2015.     This created an opportunity to connect issues and campaigns under a broad umbrella campaign.   2015s most obvious corollary is with 2005, where the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in July focussed on Africa   and climate, and was followed in December by a WTO meeting on global trade. Campaigning around   this year became known as the Make Poverty History (MPH) campaign, and was largely focussed on   governments in the Global North. It included many of the actors who would become key participants in   action/2015.     In the period between 2005 and 2015, there were a number of other global campaigning moments, and   there were significant changes in the global landscape.     Many of those interviewed for this evaluation shared their analyses of these changes, which are beyond the   scope of this report, but there was wide consensus that global campaigning in 2015 and beyond had to   operate under a new model.     The old model of change of global campaigns was largely Northern led and dominated by international   NGOs. The Theory of Change of these campaigns was aimed at influencing global targets and Northern   governments and its messaging was top down and centralised.     The new model of campaigning aims to be networked, bottom up and decentralised. It is focused on   Southern leadership and ownership, and on including organisations across the Global South to take on   leading roles in the design and planning of the campaign.     Action/2015 was a transitional campaign that deliberately sought to establish this new model for global   campaigning. It was designed to be Southern-led, inclusive and to put the ownership of the campaign   into the hands of local and national networks. It sought to build a broad membership base, that linked   together issues of poverty, inequality and climate. This determined the structure, design and delivery of the   campaign.     2.3 initial meetings anD founDing Documents   Action/2015 was founded after a number of initial, informal meetings between key organisations in global   development, climate, poverty and other areas related to its key campaign objectives.     These meetings were attended by a core group of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs)   from a variety of countries, including Save the Children (STC), ONE, Climate Action Network, Global Call to   Action Against Poverty (GCAP), Oxfam, the UN Foundation, CIVICUS, Beyond 2015 and many other (I)NGOs.   The initial meetings were attended by many of the same groups, but throughout the campaign new actors          became involved, and others worked on a distance from action/2015. In these meetings, the outline of the   campaign was shaped, designed and refined.     There are different perspectives on what can be considered the first meeting on action/2015, and at which   stage decisions were made that shaped the campaign model. Chapter 4.2 of this report, on the initial design   of the campaign, discusses the mixed opinions of stakeholders about these meetings.     The Istanbul Communiqué, coming out of the meeting in Istanbul in February 2014, was a statement of   principles signed by 80 organisations, including large NGOs like Save the Children, ONE and GCAP. It is   generally considered the founding document of action/2015 and describes its purpose, approach and   relevance.     The graphic below shows the key points and outcomes from each meeting.     Initial meetings timeline     2014 2015  Nairobi – February 2014        First meeting with formal   conversations about the design   and setup of the campaign      The initial shape and design of   the campaign was developed in   broad terms. Key conclusions of   the meeting were:      Something should happen   around 2015 and its   negotiations      It should link development   and climate      It should focus on popular   mobilisation      Around 40 organisations took   part in this meeting   Istanbul – February 2014        During this meeting the coalition agreed   on the founding principles for   action/2015, documented in the Istanbul   Communiqué      It was a crucial meeting in deciding the   direction of the campaign, stakeholder   engagement and its role towards external   partners.      Around 30 organisations took part in this   meeting, approximately half had also   attended the Nairobi meeting      Some organisations that had previously   been involved left the campaign at this   point   Johannesburg – April 2014        The key outcome of this meeting was the   campaign outline. It established the   structure, visual identity guidelines and   the timeline of key campaign mobilisation   moments   General Assembly, Johannesburg –   November 2014        The key outcome of this Assembly was the   overall messaging of the campaign and   agreement on the timeline of key   mobilisation moments   General Assembly, Tunis –   March 2015        The key outcome of this   Assembly was agreement on   the strategy and campaign   tactics for key mobilisation   moments      The Assembly provided an   opportunity to reflect on the   launch and campaign   moments so far, to share plans   and best practices for   upcoming mobilisations and   decide on next steps     2.4 action/2015 structure anD participating organisations   Around 40 organisations took part in the first meeting in Nairobi. By the end of the campaign, Action/2015   had become a movement of more than 2,200 organisations, and included networks and coalitions in 157   countries, with more than 80% of participating organisations located in the Global South.     The campaign was an explicit objective to bring together campaigners from development, environmental   and rights-based organisations.     Participating organisations came from diverse backgrounds, working on a range of issues including peace   and development, environment, climate, education, civil rights, youth, rural development, social business,   media development, elderly, health, renewable energy and more. They ranged from very small CSOs   working in rural areas with their communities and constituents, to major international NGOs.              The majority of participating organisations were traditional NGOs. Whilst there was more organisational   diversity and cross-sector relationships in some national coalitions, there was only limited wider   participation from other civil society actors, such as faith groups and trade unions.     The campaign was deliberately set up to be flexible and adaptable. Its core principles were to be inclusive,   enabling, light touch and open source, drawing on the strengths and resources of its participating   organisations.     The campaign consisted of the following governance bodies.     The terms national coordinator and national coalition lead were used interchangeably by stakeholders.   Throughout this report we use the term national coalition lead.              Connect regional to national and global   levels         2.5 key moBilisation moments   Globally, action/2015 reports there were over 31 million actions in over 100 countries in support of   action/2015. Action/2015 used a broad definition of actions, and mobilisation moments consisted of   a wide variety of activities with different amounts of individuals mobilised. These activities included   demonstrations, marches, community events, petitions, workshops, high-level panels, street bashes,   postcard actions and many more.     The timeline below gives an overview of key action/2015 moments throughout the year. This is a high level   overview of the main centrally co-ordinated activities, as the campaign was made up of a range of activities   and initiatives around the world.     2.6 key meDia anD social meDia statistics   Action/2015 achieved broad coverage on both traditional and social media (which mainly included Twitter   and Facebook). Action/2015s media impact is analysed in more detail in Chapter 5.     It is important to note that media monitoring was not centralised and while in some countries the data   offers a very accurate picture, in other countries it was not comprehensive or not a good representation of   impressions, views or mentions.          The case studies illustrate action/2015s media profile in selected countries, and provide examples of   partnerships and how action/2015 was featured in the media on a national level.         2.7 finances   Central income and expenditure     Action/2015 was a decentralised campaign, with a central budget of a little over $2.5m.     The majority of this funding was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), with the   balance coming from a small number of large INGOs. 60% of these funds were regranted through subgrants,   administered by the Global Hub to participating organisations to coordinate, resource and deliver   mobilisation activities. The remaining budget of around $1m was allocated for global coordination.   This consisted of travel and salaries for the Global Hub and regional coordinators (16.5% of total spend),   meetings and general Assemblies (11.5%), indirect costs to host organisation CIVICUS (7%) and global   communications and campaign materials (2%).     It is important to note this budget does not represent the total investment made in action/2015 by all   involved. One key characteristic of the campaign is that it unlocked a large amount of additional funding,   with participating organisations raising targeted funds and investing their own resources. In addition,   significant in-kind investments of expertise and time were made by participating organisations and others   involved in the campaign. This contribution of resources played an important role in leveraging existing   resources and increased the reach and impact of the campaign significantly.     As there is no central accounting of all this investment, it is not possible to estimate the total cost of the   campaign. As discussed in Chapter 4.5, this is in part due to the decentralised nature of the campaign,   causing barriers to a central overview and monitoring system.     The total cost and spend of the campaign are, however, likely to be an order of magnitude much greater   than the central budget.     Sub-grants system     The sub-grants that were administered to participating organisations were allocated through a grant   selection process. Participating organisations were encouraged to apply in coalitions. Funds could be used   for campaign activities or supplies (materials and resources to implement events), staff costs, transportation   and national campaign building activities (meetings). Participating organisations filled out a proposal in   which they were asked to demonstrate a fit with the overall grant focus, proven commitment and capacity   to mobilise, an implementation, budget and Monitoring and Evaluation plan and the ability to work in   partnerships. The Sub-Grant Selection Committee of the respective region then reviewed the proposals   against a scorecard. This committee consisted of 5 people: a representative from the Reference Group, the   funding action team, the regional coordinator and 2 representatives of the action teams working on the   mobilisation moment concerned. The name of the sub-grants recipients were released publicly.     The sub-grants were delivered in three rounds; the table below presents an overview of the different   rounds. The average amount of grants received per proposal was $9,244.

Aligned with the objectives of delivering a campaign that is strongly rooted in the Global South, it   shows that countries receiving most sub-grants are located in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.     Global distribution of sub-grants     3 INVOLVEMENT wITh ANd PERCEPTIONS Of ThE CAMPAIGN     3.1 introDuction   This chapter discusses stakeholders engagement with the campaign, perceptions, objectives and   expectations.     Action/2015 engaged with a large variety of stakeholders, from global, high level stakeholders from   governance bodies, the UN or national development agencies to grassroots organisations working across   the world. Stakeholders engaged with the campaign on different levels, were from different backgrounds   and geographic locations around the world.     This diversity of backgrounds and opinions has given the evaluation a diverse and dynamic view of the   strengths and weaknesses, the outcomes, effectiveness and relevance of the campaign on different levels.   Overall there was a high level of involvement with the evaluation, indicating that stakeholders are keen to   support the campaign in reviewing its effectiveness and relevance, give feedback and share their lessons   learned.     3.2 involvement With anD unDerstanDing of the campaign   The level of understanding of the campaign and its goals and objectives was relatively high and consistent,   and most peoples views of the objectives of the campaign were aligned with the formal objectives.   In contrast, understanding of the campaign model, including its structure and stakeholders role in the   campaign varied to a larger extent. While most had a clear understanding of the different governance   bodies of the campaign some (especially those working on a local level) indicated that roles and   responsibilities, especially of national coalition leads, were not always clear.     Stakeholders also spent very different proportions of time on the campaign. Some only dedicated around   10% of their daily activities to the campaign, whereas others were working on it full time. 51% of survey   respondents answered that some of their work covered the action/2015 campaign, whilst 37% answered   they were working mostly on action/2015. Members of the Global Hub and regional coordinators all   worked on the campaign full-time. Members of the Reference Group and global action teams varied in   their engagement. Most reported peak moments of time spent around key mobilisation moments, and a   few noted the launch and setup phase were very intensive. Most worked on the campaign more than they   initially expected, but this did not limit their enthusiasm around taking part.     I was the lead person in terms of designing the campaign in [my country].. One of our mandates was   building a coalition, so we had many CSOs to bring together.. I spent 100% of my time on action/2015, I was   basically action/2015 campaign manager for [my organisation].     Governance stakeholder, Africa     National coalition leads also reported very different numbers of hours spent on the campaign. Some   participating organisations found it difficult to identify how much time they spent on action/2015   specifically, because they organised activities that were linked to action/2015 but were also part of the core   work for their own organisation. A high number of stakeholders mentioned that they would have liked to   become involved with the campaign earlier, and that this could have improved their contribution and its   effectiveness.     Something that was notable during the campaign is that people developed strong relationships and   enjoyed working together; there was a positive atmosphere around participating in the campaign, sharing   views and cooperating. Some stakeholders mentioned that in previous campaigns they had worked on   there was a stronger sense of competition between participating organisations, partners and stakeholders.        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     I have previously participated in other campaigns ... This one I thought was about inclusiveness. Everything   matters to everybody. Although what brought us together were the SDG processes, everything else can be   involved.     Participating organisation, Africa     Based on stakeholders views, we suggest a number of possible reasons for this. Firstly, the campaign   consisted of a coalition of the willing, and actors that did not support the campaign did not take part,   resulting in a positive, supportive membership of the campaign. Secondly, expectations for the campaign   appeared to be relatively low, especially among those in central coordination roles that were involved in   early phases of campaign design. Those stakeholders saw the campaign as an important step towards   Southern mobilisation and ownership, but most expressed to be unsure of the outcomes and specific   results they expected the campaign to have. Since the campaign was so wide spread and had high-level   objectives, most organisations did not have key targets or competitive outcomes to meet, resulting in a   cooperative and flexible approach to the campaign. Finally, as discussed in other parts of this report, the   campaign did not have any specific policy asks, which often cause internal disagreement among partners in   a large campaign. It is not possible to be definitive about which of these made the greatest contribution to   the apparent harmony of the action/2015 coalition.     3.3 amBitions anD oBjectives for the campaign   Stakeholders at the global level and close to the central governance of the campaign expressed relatively   low expectations for action/2015. Taking into account the limited amount of centrally allocated money, they   saw the campaign mostly as a platform for Southern mobilisation providing opportunities to learn lessons   about civil society coordination and the role of public pressure. Those working on the campaign at a local   and national level generally had higher expectations for the campaign, and 80% of survey respondents to   the survey indicates the campaign met their expectations.     The campaign over exceeded my expectations.     I think the objective of action/2015 was trying to relate how decisions on the global level relate to your   everyday life. That there are global decisions that can and will impact peoples life.     Participating organisation, Latin America        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     We wanted the campaign to be able to, across the world, make leaders know and other stakeholders aware   of the fact that this [year] was terribly important. There was thought behind it and there were expectations   about ambitious outcomes. That was really what we hoped that the campaign would be able to do: have   people taking actions, popular campaigning and collating that to showcase that around the world, this is   whats happening and that theres this ground swell demanding ambitious action.     External stakeholder, global     There were three aims: Can we engage people in 2015? Can we have a positive impact on policy? Can we   learn to work together? Of these, the third one was the one that we were really into.     Governance stakeholder, global     The issue that stakeholders differed upon most was whether the campaign was and should have been set   up to influence policymaking. Some stakeholders from participating organisations expressed that only as   the campaign progressed did they come to understand that advocacy, and engaging with policy-makers,   was not among the core objectives of the campaign.     The understanding of to what extent influencing policy was part of the campaign was strongest with   global stakeholders close to the central governance of the campaign, and weaker amongst participating   organisations and those further away from central governance .     In smaller, national organisations where the person responsible for advocacy was the same person that   handles mobilisation efforts there was often a lack of such distinction, and mobilisation efforts were   combined with policy work at a local level.     We recognised that this was a moment of broad policy asks. Could we say that people cared about these   issues and wanted government action on it? Could we pull that off? Our analysis was that what was lacking   on both the COP21 and the SDGs was political will, not policy content. But everyone loves policy. My view was   that in moments of such breadth, because the gap is one of political will, the right thing to do was focus on   mobilising the public.     Governance stakeholder, global     The priorities for different countries were incredibly diverse. Many indicated their national priorities were   similar to the objectives outlined above. Other priorities that were identified by more than one stakeholder   or survey respondent were:        Those issues mentioned by individual stakeholders or survey respondents included anti- corruption,   technology transfer, child protection, transportation and water sanitation.     Few stakeholders indicated planned regional priorities, and it appeared there were not many deliberate   efforts to link priorities of countries within same region.        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     The main benefits and reasons that participating organisations outlined for taking part in action/2015 were:         Most of the organisations working in the field are not doing advocacy. My role as a coordinator is to bring   the messages from the local actors, build a message from their experience, and bring it towards the national   and global level. And action/2015 fitted really well with that.     Participating organisation, Latin America     The main reason we got involved is because it is a unique campaign. It links global to local, and it aims at   mobilising citizens. This was unique meaning that we usually target policy makers, but this was more about   masses, numbers, reaching out to everybody. And that attracted me. It was something different.     Participating organisation, Africa     3.4 WiDer stakeholDers connection With the campaign   The variety of stakeholders and organisations that engaged with action/2015 had very different   relationships to the campaign. Some organisations that were involved in or connected to the campaign   had different levels of visibility to other campaign partners, and views on these organisations participation,   contribution and role in the campaign was mixed.     A number of relevant organisations did not take part in the campaign, and some organisations that took   part played a smaller role than expected. A small number of stakeholders from these organisations took   part in this evaluation, and we have been able to include views of these organisations to some extent.   A couple of stakeholders mentioned that the fact that faith movements, trade unions and some of the big   INGOs did not commit to the campaign on a global level was a major weakness. Some of these actors did   take part in the campaign on a national level.     Based on stakeholders views, there are a number of suggested reasons for why these organisations decided   not to take part. Firstly, the dominance of a few organisations in the design and messaging of the campaign   resulted in an early focus on development, potentially alienating global civil society organisations from   other fields. Others noted that climate-focussed organisations had less capacity and capability to take a   leading role in a global mobilisation. For some, the lack of policy engagement or clear policy objectives   was a reason not to engage with the campaign. Others suggested that 2015 was not a moment for a global   coalition, and was more about specific policy asks. Additionally, the lack of awareness of action/2015   at early stages and having many activities for the SDG and COP21 agenda already planned under an   organisations own brand could have resulted in limited reasons to engage with action/2015.     It is also important to consider the impact that closer engagement with the private sector would have on   the relationship with social movements and, to a certain extent, with climate groups, particularly those that   have strong views on the private sectors role in climate change.        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     Certain NGOs, such as Action Aid, were not participating. It would be much stronger if the INGOs would   work together. I think this is due to politics or maybe they had own campaigns already. There is institutional   competition between Save the Children and Oxfam, but Oxfam affiliates participated in some countries, for   example Kenya and Italy.     Governance stakeholder, global     The climate leadership was a clear strategic gap that we recognised and tried to fix it, but I didnt feel we   could wait to find the right person. As a result, it felt led by the development sector, and in particular by Save   the Children. Some of the other big INGOs didnt engage. They focussed on their own stuff.     Governance stakeholder, global     Organisers of action/2015 often described it as a flotilla1, a loose and broad structure that allowed   organisations to engage at key moments and demonstrate broad political support without formally   reconciling multiple policy perspectives and theories of change.     The flotilla structure allowed global and local campaigners to participate on their own terms. For a number   of those in attendance, the Istanbul meeting was where the boundaries for participating began to be   drawn.     The meeting and the Istanbul Communiqué as its most important outcome were a trigger for some of   the more radical, grassroots organisations to step back from the coalition. At the same time, those who   subsequently became involved in Project Everyone, with its close partnership with the United Nations, focus   on communications and making the goals famous, recognised they would be more effective pursuing a   complementary, but separate strategy to action/2015.     Participants in the flotilla     Despite this, the campaign was made up of participating organisations from a range of campaign priorities,   representing both local and global perspectives, and both more-insider and more-outsider models of   change. This included some large organisations that had not taken part in a global campaign before.     1 A campaigning structure whereby groups agree on broad objectives and coordinate loosely around tactics but keep their own brand and do not create   strong coordination structures. In: Cox, B. (2011) Campaigning for International Justice        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     We started to bring together development, rights and environmental movements. We made significant   advances on that. [members of the] Climate Action Network, Amnesty, Avaaz, World Vision were all part of   the same campaign. That was important, but it didnt go far enough.     Governance stakeholder, global     Action/2015s relationship with participating organisations and other partners is further explored in Chapter     5.4 of this report.   Action/2015s relationship with Project Everyone was mostly visible to stakeholders at the global level.   A number of stakeholders were able to comment on this relationship and they had various opinions on   the process whereby action/2015 and Project Everyone were established as separate organisations and   whether this was the right way. Most agreed that the division of tasks that eventually emerged worked well   and that despite very different ways of working, relationships between the two groups were positive and   constructive. Project Everyone took up the marketing, communications and corporate side of promoting   the Global Goals and creating assets. These assets were then distributed through different channels   including action/2105, this distribution was rolled out mostly through joint global partners.     Action2015 was probably the most critical vehicle to distributing Project Everyone assets to civil society   across the world.      Most stakeholders expressed their understanding of the fact that action/2015 and Project Everyone had   different priorities, but suggested both could have benefited from increased cooperation.     For a number involved in the early formation of the coalition, officials from the United Nations were central   to both the formation of the campaign, and some of its key principles. UN representatives participated in   some of the early meetings, and coalition representatives participated in UN strategy calls. A number of   interviewees reported that key actors within the UN wanted strong civil society activity around the SDGs.   One reason for this was to distinguish them from the MDGs, which were seen as an elite-level process,   rather than a movement with wide popular support.     In general, those close to the centre of the campaign felt the UN relationship was constructive and   represented a new way of working and a new target for mobilisation activity. A small number of   stakeholders in national contexts suggested that action/2015 should have been a more independent   movement.     There were people in the UN system that wanted representatives of civil society there. UN officials wanted   pressure behind the SDGs, because the risk in 2015 was that the SDGs would be all process.     Governance stakeholder, global     The campaign was too aligned with the UN. It should have been an independent civil society movement.     Survey respondent     A few stakeholders indicated that action/2015s engagement with the private sector was limited and should   have been higher, since corporate actors play an important role in defining the SDGs and climate agenda.   Although some countries, as illustrated in the Kenya case study, had engagement with the private sector   on a national level, there was little to no engagement on a global level. A few stakeholders said this was a   missed opportunity.            4.1 introDuction   This chapter covers the design and delivery of the campaign, assessing its effectiveness, efficiency and   relevance. It analyses the structure, messaging and delivery of the campaign and whether it was suitable for   the objectives the campaign set out to deliver.     Overall, this evaluation finds that action/2015s campaign design and delivery were fit for purpose, based on   both qualitative and quantitative feedback.     Survey respondents assessment of campaign design     how appropriate were the following aspects of the campaign for your country?   In this chapter we will elaborate on specific feedback on the structure, messaging and the design of the   campaign, as well as on campaign materials. The chapter consists of the following sections outlined below.     Chapter 4.2 is on the design and structure of the campaign, covering the initial design, campaign structure,   cooperation and functioning of different bodies, and linking of the campaign to local context. Chapter 4.3   on messaging includes key themes and the scope of action/2015 messaging. Chapter 4.4 is on delivery and   coordination of the campaign, including planning and coordination, execution of mobilisation activities   and campaign resources. Chapter 5.5 discusses feedback on funding and the sub-grants system.     4.2 Design anD structure of the campaign   The initial design of the campaign     As outlined in Chapter 2 the action/2015 campaign was designed in a number of high-level meetings by a   group of key actors. Several of those involved as this stage reported that the early phases of planning and   campaign design were not inclusive. Some felt that the campaign was dominated by a few actors (with Save   the Children UK most often mentioned).          A number of stakeholders expressed their frustration with these early meetings. They report that the   dominant members present took charge of decisions and the campaign narrative. Others expressed their   frustration with not being invited at all. One stakeholder mentioned that international development   organisations were overrepresented in these early meetings, thereby having a strong impact on the   language and wording of the campaign. Another reported that attempts to engage climate groups in this   early stage were made, but strong leaders had not been found.     In contrast, most reported that the later stages of campaign planning were more inclusive. Many added that   while Save the Children was dominant in the planning phase, it was less so in later stages and played a very   important role in delivering and coordinating the campaign.     Several commented that starting to plan earlier for the design and development of a campaign that spans a   full year could have improved its effectiveness and impact.     Stakeholders had strong and divergent views on whether the campaign should have had an increased focus   on policy makers. Whether the design of the campaign was fit for influencing policy making is discussed in   this chapter, as well as in Chapter 5.6 of this report.     Structure of the campaign     One of the biggest strengths of the campaign that was mentioned by almost all stakeholders was its   opt-in structure. The flexibility of the campaign, enabling everyone to take out what most fits their cause   and organisation, worked extremely well and was appreciated by all parties. The flotilla structure was   considered a good model for the campaign and a big part of its success. A few commented that the   loose structure made it difficult to secure long-term commitment and did not stimulate partners to take   responsibility beyond the own organisation.     The flotilla model was a double-edged sword. It enabled organisations to drop in and out, they werent   tied in for the whole year. Some stayed and others came in and out. This was a real strength but it was hard   to get people to take on leadership roles.     Governance stakeholder, Europe     The flexible, collaborative structure of the campaign allowed participating organisations to use their own   ideas and creativity and to learn from each other.     Being given high-level objectives, resources and guidelines while having the freedom to link it to issues,   audiences or activities most relevant to their own organisations worked well and inspired enthusiasm and   cooperation.     It gave Southern organisations capacity, resources, communications products and good reasons to work   together at a national level. It meant they didnt have to sign up to a whole platform of issues.     Governance stakeholder, global     Our participation in action/2015 is better and more intense [than in previous campaigns] because   materials, resources, how to do it documents and funding was made available. You are more motivated   because you see reports, pictures and videos from other regions streaming in. And the coordination from the   action/2015 team is superb.     Survey respondent          A few stakeholders at the global level commented on the limited capacity for basic centrally coordinated   campaign functions, such as fundraising and communications. This was considered a weakness of the   campaign and something that could have improved its overall effectiveness. Some expressed there was a   need for stronger coordination on these areas, as they are key enablers of a successful campaign. However,   adding these functions would have added significant coordination costs and made the organisation move   more slowly.     Coordination at a regional level was considered weaker, particularly in the case of Africa. Some stakeholders   called for stronger regional coordination, believing it could have had a big impact on outcomes and   effectiveness. In the case of the FFD summit this could have been an important opportunity to promote   regional priorities and coordinate regionally, but no such coordination happened.     What I think we could have done much better is at the regional level. For example, the African Union   Commission are critical in pushing African voices at a global level ... We didnt have specific plans to engage   them. I think one of the proposals we put in for the second round of funding was to do that, but of course   resources are limited. When engaging at regional level you need more resources and coordination. I think we   did lose a bit of an opportunity there.     Participating organisation, Africa     With regards to the regional coordination of Latin America, stakeholders commented that it was difficult   to engage the Caribbean region with the campaign. Some suggested involvement of this region could be   improved if it was considered separate from Latin America, although they questioned whether this was   feasible in practice.     Cooperation and functioning of different bodies     The structure of the different bodies of action/2015 and their role in the campaign was well understood and   broadly considered an effective model for the campaign. Stakeholders were unanimously positive about the   Global Hub. The level of positive feedback on the Global Hub Coordinator was remarkable. One stakeholder   called the Global Hub a dream team and many applauded its commitment, responsiveness, ability to   translate everything in three languages and general ability to build a personal relationship with everyone   and connect action/2015.     The Global Hub took some time to set up, it was a lot of work for very few people. They managed to build a   lot of trust around the campaign and that was crucial for this to work. They played a major role.     Governance stakeholder, global     The feedback on the Reference Group was mixed, from both stakeholders that were members of the   Reference Group themselves as well as from other stakeholders who commented on its effectiveness and   relevance.     A couple suggested that the idea of the Reference Group was good, but that in practice its members were   selected too early and that roles and responsibilities were not clear. Some members of the Group played an   important role, but others were not very active. The Group as a whole could have played a stronger role in   advising, planning for the future and involving their network, thereby potentially increasing involvement   from other large organisations. A few noted that the Reference Group had very competent people in it but   only 5 or 6 of them, depending on the moment, were active at any one time.     Feedback on the global action teams was generally positive, although few stakeholders mentioned them   without prompting. The action teams were seen to play an important role in the development of materials   and engaging particular audiences, such as the youth ambassadors. The action teams that were responsible   for fundraising and communications did not work as efficiently as was required for global coordination of   these important campaigning areas. Some suggested there was the need for stronger, full time coordinators   with clear priorities, to prevent coordinators from having to balance fundraising for action/2015 with          fundraising efforts for their own organisations.   The extent to which the role of a national coalition lead functioned varied significantly per country.   Although stakeholders were generally positive and saw a lead person per country as an important role, the   responsibilities of the coordinator were not clear in some countries. One stakeholder was not aware of the   fact that most countries had a national coordinator. The different roles that national coalition leads fulfilled   can be categorised as:       Sometimes it seemed there was a lack of coordination.. [Organisations in my country] would all do the   same.. It would make sense if each country would have a lead coordinator or organisation that takes things   forward… Everybody expected [organisation in my country] to take up this role, but it didnt. We are now   sharing information, but it would have been better if we would have had that from the beginning, so this   coordinator would take the lead and we would have action/2015 [in my country] and we would have one   work plan.     Participating organisation, Africa     Several stakeholders that were able to comment on the role of Save the Children on a global level   suggested that it would have made sense for the London-based action/2015 team of Save the Children to   join the Global Hub or to have more local presence in Africa, Latin America and Asia.     One stakeholder from outside the campaign considered the lack of CEO or central leadership figure in   the action/2015 campaign difficult to engage with. This was a minority view. Others commented on the   absence of a central leadership, but mostly felt that a CEO or a centralised decision-making body was   incompatible with the structure of a decentralised campaign.     Linking of campaign to local context, involvement of participating organisations     Most stakeholders were positive about action/2015s efforts to link the campaign to the local context and   to involve participating organisations in campaign planning. The assessment of whether the campaign   succeeded in making these links work in practice was more critical.     I really appreciated the fact that we were able to adapt the campaign to the national reality. This is the first   time that a campaign is so open for that.     Participating organisation, Latin America          The survey indicates that most participating organisations felt they were involved in the planning of the   campaign in their country.     Campaign planning should have been more participatory and inclusive, according to the majority of those   involved. Many say it should have involved representative organisations earlier and to a much greater   extent. The campaign was generally considered to have much stronger Southern presence and support   than previous campaigns in international development and climate change. However, many of the key   responsibilities and much of the design of the campaign was still managed in or from the Global North.     Action/2015 became a top down campaign… These processes are so difficult to manage, but get them   [participating organisations] to design the campaign... That will only happen when 20 of these coalitions are   asked to come together and asked what they want to campaign for, how they want to campaign. Investing   in that process is also very important... If for example Save the Children had said we will ensure that at least   5 of our country heads will sit in the designing of the campaign, it would have been very different. Nothing   against INGOs, but a country director will know this will work in my country.     Governance stakeholder, global     Action/2015 was most effective where it could build on existing coalitions or networks, in countries   where this was possible (such as the Wada Na Todo network in India and GCAP in a number of countries).   Comparing the campaigns effectiveness in different countries shows that building on existing local   structures is one of the key lessons learned from action/2015. Some suggested there were existing networks   that could have been leveraged more in other countries.     I think it worked really well because [the leading organisation in my country] became that central forum..   When action/2015 was launched there was discussion on the national coalition, and it was only fitting that   a national organisation that was already doing such work would take the lead. It worked very well because it   was not a new coalition that was established, but there were already recognised players.     Participating organisation, Asia          Many stakeholders, especially in French and Spanish speaking regions, mentioned the importance of   connecting the campaign to the local context by using the local language as much as possible. Local   partners are much less inclined to take part or be active when materials and communications are in English.   Although action/2015 was praised for its efforts to provide everything in three languages (English, Spanish   That the key themes of the action/2015 campaign were the fight against climate change, poverty and   inequality was understood and supported by all stakeholders. Action/2015 included organisations working   on all three of these issues and many more. It is a key outcome of the campaign that so many organisations   ended up integrating and linking messaging from these three wider themes to their own messaging. This   was most often mentioned in relation to climate change; various organisations that had never participated   in activities or adopted messaging about climate change got involved with action/2015 and included   climate issues in their campaigns and materials.     Some stakeholders mentioned the predominance of international development language in the messaging   and key themes of the campaign, attributing this to the predominance of development organisations in the   initial planning phases.     For some, this created a real obstacle to being involved in the campaign. As they did not agree with the   tone of messaging and the international development angle, one organisation felt that they could not   stand behind the core of the campaign, since communicating in development language could have   adverse affect on the international negotiation processes.     Within the campaign overall the biggest moment, or what was pushed as the biggest moment, was the SDG   summit. Although the campaign is about SDGs and COP21 I think most organisations in the coalitions work   more specifically on development than climate.     Governance stakeholder, global     When considering the connection and overlap between the three key themes of the campaign it is   important to note that linking climate change, poverty and inequality was a significant step in connecting   global challenges. The problems of the world are interconnected, and cannot be seen in silos. The campaign   stimulated thinking about the links and relationships between key international challenges, sectors, themes   and negotiations.     A few suggested that the campaign could have taken even greater steps in doing so.     It [the campaign] is a good aggregator of stories of actions in various parts of the world, therefore giving   spaces for participation and involvement. But it has limited itself to telling the happy stories but not in telling   the sharper narratives of the intrinsic link between human rights and development and environment or   climate change, thus the calls were not as transformative or radical as it should be.     Survey respondent     The scope of action/2015 messaging     The messaging of the action/2015 campaign emerged as a result of its open nature and decentralised   structure. There was a deliberate choice to focus on top line messages rather than detail. The campaign   avoided making campaign messaging directive by targeting specific SDGs, outcomes or issues. These   choices were well understood and supported.          This meant that for many, messaging was easily adaptable and enabled organisations to align it to their   own organisations themes and purposes. For others this was a drawback, as it meant that messaging (as   well as resources, which will be discussed in the next section) was very much framed in a global language   and therefore not always applicable to the local context. Some indicated that terms like sustainable   development or even climate change or inequality mean little to beneficiaries and constituents in rural   communities.     It is very common for ideas to come from the Europe, so the West, from England, which are totally removed   from the realities of countries like mine. For us, for example, it made no sense to ask 15 years olds how   they imagine themselves at 30 because they dont picture themselves at 30. In some zones it is extremely   dangerous here. For some young people, imagining themselves in 15 years is science fiction.     Governance stakeholder, Latin America     These stakeholders suggested that the campaign could have generated more energy and commitment by   focusing on specific issues. On a local level this would provide a clearer link to peoples everyday lives, but   also on a national or global level it would give a clearer call to action.     A few stakeholders expressed their doubts about the concept of action/2015 and elaborated that you   cant really claim a year.They were of the opinion that you can claim a day or an issue, but that a year is not   a feasible or effective framework for a campaign, and that some of the challenges with the delivery and   coordination of the campaign arose from the 1-year structure. Taking into account that the first half-year   consisted of relatively less important mobilisation moments, they suggested that action/2015 could have   been a 6-month campaign from Addis to COP21 with the SDGs in the middle. Others were enthusiastic   about the fact that action/2015 spanned a whole year of activities, because that enabled organisations to   pick and choose the moments that were most relevant for their organisations and constituents.     Overall, stakeholders found that action/2015 had a positive and inclusive narrative and that its themes and   messaging reflected this; it gave guidelines for messaging and then left everyone free to use their creativity   to choose those issues most applicable to the local context. This worked well and inspired cooperation,   sharing and creativity.     It felt that it hung together well. These moments dont come along very often and it felt very focused, the   moment and the communications around it were very good. You can imagine that with 17 goals and all   the arguments about how many goals there were it could have got very messy but somehow it seems that   we had something very clear and strong to communicate to our key audiences, particularly the importance   of getting strong goals and holding governments to account. I think its been a very good clear coherent   campaigning message, throughout the year.     Participating organisation, Europe     One global stakeholder noted that action/2015 was not an easy campaign to build a message structure   around. Not only did it not have a clear call to action, or strong policy content, it was about reasonably   esoteric global processes.     It was not an easy proposition. It was not the strongest call to action, but it didnt feel like there were   compelling alternatives that we missed. Getting people out and excited about UN processes is not the easiest   ask.     Governance stakeholder, global          4.4 Delivery anD coorDination of the campaign   Planning and coordination of the campaign     The majority of stakeholders was positive about the delivery and coordination of the campaign.   Organisations chose moments, activities or messages that were most appropriate for their organisation. This   defined coordination and planning processes to a large extent as it allowed participating groups to connect   action/2015 to their existing campaigning and planning cycles.     Many stakeholders praised action/2015 for the successful delivery of a global campaign of this scope and   breadth.     Its important to remember that one of the things action/2015 was pitched as, at the start of the campaign,   was the idea that you could do what you were already planning to do with the action/2015 brand, as   opposed to creating lots of different activities. There are a number of activities that happened as a result of   action/2015 coordinating or coming together but there are also plenty of activities that have an action/2015   flavour to them because of the way that the campaign was structured. I think that worked well for people   and they found it easier to engage with.     Governance stakeholder, Europe     Action/2015 is the most effective, most massive campaign I've ever been involved in.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     Some felt that the volume of mobilisation events was very high, so there was limited space to reflect   upon previous events, or to build up a learning cycle. In some instances, the planning felt rushed and too   much – we were running from one event to the next. On the other hand, participating organisations also   appreciated that they could pick and choose from events linked to their cause and a couple of stakeholders   praised action/2015s ambitious agenda of activities, which offered so many opportunities for mobilisation.   Many commented on the importance of aligning the timing of mobilisation activities with the local context.   In some countries organising a demonstration on a weekday simply does not work, but in other countries   religious or cultural traditions make it difficult to plan events on Saturdays or Sundays.     Best practices from India showed that spreading mobilisation over a few days or a week around the key   mobilisation date(s) worked well, also relieving some of the logistical pressure to organise many activities at   the same time. It is then necessary to ensure that mobilisation is still clearly linked to the global moment /   event, as this is an important part of action/2015s role in connecting local and global issues.     One of the main strengths was bringing together a broad cross section of society around the world, to   mobilise and take action on these moments that were happening throughout the year. Ive never seen that   happen before… You could see people from cities like London to really remote villages in say Tanzania all   mobilising on the same day and that was quite incredible.     Governance stakeholder, global     Another issue around coordination was that planning sometimes happened suddenly, and that the   turnaround time for translating or signing off materials was at times short. For example, one stakeholder   cited the press release that came out for International Womens Day that had to be signed off and   distributed in a very short period of time. It was understood that this was also a product of external   circumstances, however, having a timeline that allows for more space would increase the campaigns   effectiveness.     Many stakeholders commended action/2015 for its efforts to provide a high number of contact   moments and opportunities for connecting, and were positive about the frequency and effectiveness of          communication between global, regional and national levels. Governance bodies or individuals such as the   action teams and national coalition leads had regular check in-calls and many participating organisations   had bi-weekly calls with key partners and/or national coalition leads. Most viewed these calls as helpful and   supportive of the planning process.     Sometimes when you are in charge, it helps if people keep reminding you. You dont get left out. It gives you   the morale and the ability to organise as quickly and as soon as possible.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     Google Groups were the main tool for online coordination. The groups were generally thought be an   effective way to keep everyone involved and updated on what was happening in the campaign around the   world. A couple of stakeholders stated that the Google Groups provided a great opportunity to connect   with participating organisations around the world (for example to connect with organisations that are   working on the same themes and issues in another region of the world). This led to sharing of ideas,   learning and creating possibly lasting relationships.     Some felt that at times there was an overload of information and emails, especially when the   communications were not collaborative, one stakeholder described this as pushing out of information.   The methods of communication most often mentioned by stakeholders from participating organisations   were email, via the Google Group, Skype, Facebook and Whatsapp.     Execution of mobilisation activities     The execution of mobilisation activities was largely determined by countries national priorities and the   types and backgrounds of participating organisation who coordinated mobilisation activities. In some cases   key partners coordinated general activities and others organised themselves around these, in other cases   participating organisations organised their own activities linking to a specific theme.     Delivery of activities was to a large extent dependent on participating organisations resources and capacity.   Although the sub-grants provided a good platform, and for some organisations were the only reason they   could participate, executing mobilisation activities was dependent on human resources and available   capacity. A number of participating organisations indicated that implementation timelines were sometimes   too short, making it challenging to organise and execute mobilisation activities effectively.     delivery of key mobilisation moments     launch until before   may mobilisation     Strengths:        In this phase the campaign was   still building up and many   participating organisations got   inspired and joined the campaign   during this time      The launch and the send a   postcard to your PM action were   evaluated positively by many and   called a highlight of the campaign   Weaknesses:        Choosing 15 January as a launch   date was arbitrary and it was not   clear to everyone why this was the   date chosen for the launch      In many countries the action/2015   coalition was not yet established,   and coordination of these   activities was therefore somewhat   fragmented. Some indicated that   key moments later in the   campaign worked better   financing for Development     Strengths:        This was the first of the three key   moments of the coalition, and   stakeholders reported a high level   of enthusiasm and engagement.   This is reflected by the high   number of people that were   mobilised for this event      Many African countries linked their   policy work to the FFD summit.   Impact on this was visible, for   example the delegation using   action/2015 wording      FFD generated a high level of   Twitter engagement, especially in   African countries   Weaknesses:        FFD would have been a good   opportunity to present regional   African priorities, but this did not   happen      A majority of exposure in   traditional media (media   mentions) was in the US and not in   African countries   unga     Strengths:        For many the UNGA was the key   moment of the campaign, and   everyone indicated high   engagement      Many stakeholders, especially   respondents to the survey,   indicated that Light the Way was   one of the most successful   elements of the campaign      A number of participating   organisations called out how   special it was to feel part of the   negotiations in New York through   action/2015   Weaknesses:        A minority of global stakeholders   questioned whether Light the   Way should have been a separate   event, indicating that the SDGs/   Global Goals itself were the   message, and that action/2015   shouldn't have sidetracked from   that with Light the Way   cop 21     Strengths:        Many participating organisations   that had not previously worked on   climate engaged with the   campaign and included climate in   their work because of their   activities around the COP   21summit      Some participating organisations   indicated their governments had   limited commitment to COP21   (much less than with UNGA) and   that action/2015 gave them a   reason and the tools to put climate   firmer on the agenda   Weaknesses:        Some indicated that action/2015   could have been more present at   the COP21, and that they expected   higher visibility of the campaign.   This needs to be considered in the   context of the Paris attacks, which   caused some organisations to   change their plans        For every campaign moment, we spent more time on planning and designing the campaign, than providing   anchors and partners with ample time to implement. This has led to tremendous pressures on the local   mobilisers, but we are very happy with the results they've come up with each time.     Survey respondent     The chart below gives an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the planning and delivery of key   mobilisation moments and phases.     International Youth Day, on the 12th of August, was also mentioned as a successful moment of the   campaign by many. The concept around #YouthPower messaging was found to be creative, relevant and   powerful, and the responsiveness and inclusiveness of co-chairs of the Youth action team were a key   strength.     Campaign resources     Most comments on campaign resources came from participating organisations. Responses to the survey   show that 42% found the campaign resources very appropriate, and 36% found them fairly appropriate.   The feedback from Spanish-speaking countries in the interviews and the survey was more critical   than experiences from French and English speaking regions. Although there were several points for   improvement, overall feedback on campaign resources was positive.     They were brilliant at distributing toolkits and being advocates on the ground.     External stakeholder, global     There were diverse opinions on the level to which participating organisations felt they were involved in the   development of campaign materials and the extent to which they were applicable in a local context. Some   said the resources were quite Northern and online focused, making it difficult for communities with limited   internet access to engage.     Others felt that resources used a lot of global language and images, suggesting that materials might   be more useful if, for example, the faces on campaign posters would be localised for different regions.   Others felt it was natural that the supplied materials were global, and they needed to be adjusted to the   local reality. They were generally very happy with the materials provided, and could localise them when   necessary. It is, however, important that materials are supplied in a format that enables editing, which was   not always the case.     Others expressed they were able to adjust materials to the local context, but would have liked some more   guidance on how to do that, especially in the beginning of the year. As the campaign progressed, there was   more sharing of best practices and examples, and this was considered very useful. More detailed feedback   on campaign materials can be found in the case studies in the Appendix.     As was the case with feedback on general planning processes, some noted that campaign materials   sometimes arrived late, not leaving much time for adaptation or translation in local languages.          We experienced the campaign structure, messages and materials as very well prepared and useful. Some   of the messages needed of course to be translated and adapted culturally. Some of the Communication Kits   could perhaps have been sent out a little earlier, due to translation, adjustments and to prepare and engage   the coalition to activity on social media.     Survey Respondent     4.5 funDing of the campaign   Only a limited number of stakeholders were able to comment on the funding and finances of the campaign.   Those that were able to comment on a global level indicated that action/2015 was a successful campaign   relative to the level of central funds available.     As discussed in Chapter 2, one of the key characteristics of the campaign was that it unlocked additional   funding and resources from participating organisations and the total value of the campaign is therefore   much larger than the income and spend of the Global Hub. This was highlighted by a few global level   stakeholders. The lack of a complete financial picture is a necessary consequence of a decentralised   campaign structure. There is a trade-off between the governance of a centralised accounting system   that allows accurate assessments of value for money and more flexible, decentralised approaches that   potentially lever in larger amounts of money for less oversight.     Evaluations typically seek to come to some estimate of value for money. The challenge of estimating value   for money becomes difficult when it is impossible to provide a baseline for total cost. Voluntary reporting   and estimates of spend would partly address this, though we did not test the extent to which there was   enthusiasm or resistance to this.     In practice, the majority of stakeholders we spoke to who had invested in the campaign outside the central   budgets were happy with their levels of investment, and the impact they had achieved with it. The general   impression among most stakeholders was that the coalition did not have a high budget given the ambition   and reach of the campaign, and that, in general, relatively small amounts of money were spent prudently.     Some stakeholders noted that the majority of resources were controlled or allocated by the large   international NGOs, and this raised questions of ownership, power and agency. They felt that resources   and funding were still Northern focused, and that action/2015 could have benefited from a more balanced   division of resources with a stronger focus on the Global South. Some indicated that in order to run a   balanced decentralised campaign it is important to ensure that resources are allocated according to needs.   They felt that if Southern based organisations do not receive the resources to recruit staff or set up systems   needed for full participation at a global campaigning level, the design and creation of campaign strategies   and materials will be dominated by those from the Global North with more resources.     A few stakeholders that were able to assess the role of funders commented that CIVICUS could have been   more involved with the campaign at an earlier stage, seeing that it was chosen because of its position and   expertise in the Global South. Some suggested that the resources of the Save the Children action/2015   team in London should have been based with the Global Hub or in-country, thereby funnelling more   resources to a regional or country level.     A few stakeholders indicated that the global finances of the campaign could be improved. As mentioned   previously, the limited fundraising capacity at a central level was a key challenge. Some felt it was   contradictory for the campaign to rely on participating organisations to raise funds for a central platform.   The limited amount of money available at a central level especially compromised action/2015s   effectiveness around hiring Global Hub staff on time, enabling the planning and payment of sub-grants   properly and to properly finance the COP21 mobilisations.          Sub-grants for participating organisations     Many stakeholders saw the sub-grants system as effective and relevant. It boosted global capacity and   was one of the key reasons for the successful delivery of action/2015 mobilisation activities. Without the   sub-grants, many grassroots organisations would not have had the resources to organise activities and   to develop existing staff members skills or attract new people. CIVICUS was effective in coordinating the   logistics of transferring the sub-grants.     It provided [my organisation] with an international forum and we were given global visibility. It helped my   organisation to expand its network, to develop. If they had not selected us or given us a grant we would have   missed all that – now my people have more experience.     Governance stakeholder, Asia     Many stakeholders mention lack of funds as the key barrier to continued engagement in the future with the   issues action/2015 worked on.     Big campaigns need big money. We were getting small bits and expected to do a lot. We had to put in quite   a lot of our own resources, but I am sure other organisations were not able to do that.     Participating organisation, Africa     A number of stakeholders indicated there were some challenges around the allocation and timings of the   sub-grants. In some cases, participating organisations applied for a grant and were allocated only half of   the amount expected, since the grant was distributed among more partners than anticipated. There was   an understanding that resources need to be given out in a fair and effective way, but this made it hard to   deliver on activities.     Some stakeholders also commented there were more resources available in early funding rounds. A few,   particularly survey respondents, commented that sub-grants were not always given to organisations that   worked most effectively with the resources given. One suggested there could be improved oversight on the   spending of sub-grants.     Sometimes I wondered if there was transparency and equity in resource allocation. Some organisations got   more resources but had very little impact on the ground as compared to those that received less. Next time it   will be good to know who does what and who has the influence.     Survey respondent     Another issue that could be improved was the timing of allocating funding relative to carrying out the   actual activities. For example, sometimes participating organisations would need to wait for a month to   hear whether the bid was approved, and then all activities needed to be delivered in two weeks.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES       5.1 introDuction   In this chapter, we will discuss impact and outcomes of the campaign, assessing how it performed against   the objectives it was set out to deliver. This chapter consists of the following sections.     Chapter 5.2 is on overall impact, discussing high-level outcomes. Chapter 5.3 covers increased public   awareness, including public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015, public awareness of the   campaign and endorsement of its objectives. Chapter 5.4 is on impact through inspiring the public to   take action and mobilisations. Chapter 5.5 is on building a stronger civil society movement, analysing how   action/2015 created a space for CSOs to work together and increase local skills and capacity. And lastly,   chapter 5.6 is on influencing policy as a means of impact.     This chapter on impact is supported by case studies on six countries: India, Kenya, Nigeria, Benin, Mexico   and the United Kingdom. These can be found in the Appendix. In these case studies we identify the key   priorities, organisations, mobilisation moments and lessons learned per country. They provide experiences   from countries that were active participants from the launch of the campaign and where across-sector   partnerships highlight best practices and important lessons learned.     5.2 overall impact   Of its three objectives, action/2015 made the biggest impact in terms of building a stronger civil society   sector. This followed from both qualitative and quantitative data, although this was found stronger in   qualitative interviews than in responses to the survey.       IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     Respondents to the survey indicated that action/2015s impact was strongest on their own organisation and   on CSOs in their country.   5.3 increase puBlic aWareness   Raising public awareness was one of the three main objectives of the action/2015 campaign. Key outcomes   to meet this objective were:    This evaluation finds that action/2015 was relatively successful at raising public awareness; quantitative   and qualitative indicators show increased awareness of the opportunities and risks of 2015. It is important   to note this can only in some cases be attributed to action/2015, since many other organisations were   working on these issues. There is substantial evidence of increased campaign visibility and endorsement of   campaign objectives over the course of the year.   Some elements of action/2015 worked particularly well and led to increased impact and awareness of the   campaign. The involvement of young people in particular generated interest and engagement from a wide   range of audiences.   Young people listen to young people and old people listen to young people too.   External stakeholder, global   IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     The strength of action/2015 lies in the fact that the majority of its governance was made up of young   activists. It was the power of youth. There was engagement, dynamism, and determination in the global   governing team and in local teams who implemented the campaign.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     Another factor that played an important role in increasing awareness was the role of social media. In most   regions Twitter was the dominant medium, in Latin America it was Facebook. Twitter was the key tool to   engage new audiences, showcase action/2015 activities and engage constituents and beneficiaries with   the campaign. For some, increased social media presence was an end in itself, and smaller organisations   reported the value of being retweeted by larger organisations or by a large numbers of people.     I have been on Twitter for a while but I have not ever been as active as Ive been this last year. I have learned   a lot from this process. I have gained a lot more followers because I have been active. There are people who   mention or share my tweets. I think it shows the power of communication in campaigns like this.     Participating organisation, Africa     The importance of social media needs to be seen in context, and is often overestimated in developing   countries, especially in Asia. While social media is widespread and has a cross-cutting audience in Northern   countries, internet access and use of social media is less widespread in some developing countries,   especially in rural areas.     The involvement of celebrities in action/2015 was another important aspect of the campaign. The campaign   secured endorsement from a number of international celebrities, most visibly Malala Yousafzai and One   Direction. This generated considerable media interest. It also had a positive effect on commitment to the   campaign; peaks in campaign registration were linked to moments when celebrities were engaging actively   with the campaign, e.g. Malala in December 2014 and One Direction in July / August 2015.     Few stakeholders mentioned celebrity involvement spontaneously or indicated they perceived it as a key   strength of the campaign.     Public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015     Action/2015 played an important role in increasing public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015.     To the statement action/2015 has raised public awareness of the agreements made in 2015 (SDGs   and climate) 42% of survey respondents answered strongly agree and 41% answered slightly agree.   Respondents in Spanish speaking countries saw lower evidence of awareness (only 28% answered strongly   agree, as opposed to 51% in French speaking countries and 46% in English speaking countries). This was   most likely because they experienced the campaign still as English-dominated, and experienced difficulties   in localising or translating campaign resources on time, as discussed in the previous chapter and the case   studies.     Because of the wide variety of events and awareness raising activities, especially around the SDGs and   COP21, it is not possible to assess the extent to which increased awareness can directly be attributed to   action/2015. There was a range of organisations working on these issues and impact can only be attributed   to action/2015 in some cases.     Stakeholders who worked on a community level gave examples of how constituents and beneficiaries of   their organisation now have a better understanding of what the SDGs or the COP21 negotiations entail, and   how this can affect their everyday life.     This needs to be considered in a local context, as increased awareness means different things at different   levels. In some rural areas, concepts such as Sustainable Development Goals are global terms that do not   mean much to the community. But while there may not be increased awareness of the SDGs themselves,        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     stakeholders cited examples of people having a better understanding of how the issues the community   does care about (such as clean water, having something to eat tomorrow and having land to live and work   on) are related to the SDGs or climate negotiations. Rather than amplifying local issues, action/2015 linked   global issues to local realities. Both the survey and the stakeholder interviews mentioned examples of   such increased awareness, providing evidence of increased awareness and understanding of the risks and   opportunities of 2015.     Action/2015 hasnt amplified local issues, but it wasnt designed to. It has localised global issues.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     A few participating organisations commented that the campaign assumed a level of basic awareness about   the issues it was working on, and stated this was not the case in their local context, making it difficult to   raise awareness.     Our region is not yet accustomed to campaigning and there was a general lack of awareness to the issues. So   it was a bit difficult to build momentum in the beginning. I think the campaign makes an assumption about   the level of awareness in certain regions that would make the campaign successful.     Survey respondent     Some stakeholders, particularly those that were involved in grassroots and community activities, indicated   that awareness was generally stronger among constituents and beneficiaries in urban areas. While they   made every effort to go out into rural areas and work with disadvantaged and vulnerable communities,   these activities often had a small reach, and limited access to internet made engagement more difficult.     While the majority of stakeholders felt that action/2015 has been successful at raising awareness on a   national and local level, there was little awareness of regional risks and opportunities. As discussed in   Chapter 4 on campaign design, identifying regional risks and opportunities and communicating them as   key priorities may have led to a larger impact for the campaign, especially around the FFD meeting.     Some compared awareness of the SDGs and the Global Goals to the level of awareness of the Millennium   Development Goals (MDGs). They found that the movement creating increased awareness of the SDGs,   including action/2015, has been very successful. A US public opinion poll shows that in the summer of 2015   8% of the US population was aware of the MDGs, but one week after the UNGA in September 20% of the   population was aware of the SDGs1. Although this impact cannot be attributed to action/2015 directly, it   shows overall increased awareness of the SDGs.     The MDGs were running for 15 years and people were not aware of what they were at the grass roots.   Through the work of action/2015, a great percentage of Nigerians are now aware of what the SDGs are and   what they stand for. For me this was very significant because its only the awareness of such kinds of goals   that will make [Nigerians] take actions that will lead to accountability. [action/2015] created the movement,   it created the follow up for the SDGs that the MDGs couldnt have.     Participating organisation, Africa     Public awareness of the action/2105 campaign and endorsement of its objectives     Stakeholders were positive about awareness of action/2015 and its objectives. Their ability to assess   awareness on different levels was determined by whether they engaged with the campaign on a local,     national,   regional   or   global   level.   Qualitative   and   quantitative   indicators   show   increased   awareness   of   the       campaign over the course of 2015.          IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     A global survey of public opinion was beyond the scope of this evaluation. However, public participation   in mobilisation events, social media activity and other modes of engagement with the campaign can all be   seen as proxies for endorsement of the campaigns objectives.     Some stakeholders cited examples of being recognised by partners, by other CSOs in their country or by   government officials as being part of action/2015. Many expressed that their participation in action/2015   generated interest or acknowledgement of the campaign among a wide range of audiences. Many   participating organisations indicated they used action/2015 branding or the action/2015 logo for most   mobilisation activities during 2015.     I think the impact is huge in Kenya because a lot of the government ministries have heard of action/2015....   I still meet people that say Oh you are from action/2015!. They would'nt remember [my organisation] but   they have seen them marching on the street.     Participating organisation, Africa     Quantitative   indicators   on   action/2015s   media   profile   show   that   the   campaign   generated   increased       awareness over time. This was mostly concentrated around mobilisation moments, in the build up to the   UNGA in September, with some media activity around the COP21 in December.     Media and Twitter engagement with action/2015     From the number of media mentions it becomes evident there is a global spread of media mentions and   social media activity. The highest number of mentions are in the United States, the United Kingdom and   India. The FFD chart shows an even greater dominance of media mentions in the US.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     5.4 inspiring the puBlic to take action, moBilisation activities   Action/2015s second objective was to inspire the public to take action in support of action/2015. Key   outcomes to meet this objective were:        Engaged   public   through   online   actions   (online   petitions,   social   media   activities,   etc.)      Engaged   public   through   in-person   activities      Engagement   of   decision   makers   around   action/2015.   In this section we will discuss the first two objectives. Chapter 5.6 will discuss engagement of policy makers   and decision makers with the campaign.     As discussed in Chapter 2, action/2015 consisted of a variety of mobilisations across the globe. The map   below shows mobilisations around the world, indicating the number of individuals that participated in   mobilisation activities throughout the year.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     Action/2015 mobilisations by country in 2015       Source: Overview of mobilisation moments including: launch/ before May mobilisation, various May mobilisations, FFD, International Youth Day, UNGA, Climate   Summit mobilisation     In most countries the campaign launch, Financing for Development, International Youth Day, UNGA and   COP21 were the biggest mobilisation moments. The May Mobilisations spanned a wide range of activities   in the month of May around a diverse set of themes such as citizen participation, climate, gender, labour   rights, sexual and reproductive health and Africa Day (25 May). This was a key component of the delivery of   large mobilisation numbers during the action/2015 campaign.     The graph below gives an overview of the number of individuals that was mobilised at key campaign   moments. Because of inconsistencies in the mobilisation data it is important to note that these numbers   illustrate the amount of actions taken, and do not offer a complete overview of all actions.     Individuals mobilised for key action/2015 moments        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     For many, mobilisation was not an end in itself but a way to show that the public understands and cares   about issues like poverty, inequality and climate change. When asked about the success of a particular   mobilisation or activity, many highlighted how these led to pressure on government officials or illustrated   that the citizens of countries all over the world care about what happened in New York or Paris.     The best evidence of action/2015s achievements in my country were media coverage, the general public   talking a lot about SDGs during radio programmes, government leaders referring to our policy demands   during public meetings, and more CSOs joining the national platform.     Survey respondent     The mobilisation by action/2015 was a very powerful voice. Had it not been there then the pressure and   stake of civil society would not have been that strong. The involvement of civil society by the UN really got   strengthened by action/2015. It created pressure.     Participating organisation, Asia     Some indicated their organisation delivered more activities throughout the year because of their   participation in action/2015. One stakeholder illustrated that while normally his organisation would   organise activities mostly around issues directly related to his organisation, participating in action/2015   resulted in being active all-year round.     A few stakeholders commented that many organisations took part in action/2015 as part of a wider   organisational strategy. Some were already working on the issues that they engaged with under the   action/2015 umbrella. There is a strong variation between countries on this point; in some cases the   activities around the SDGs and other key moments were predominantly related to action/2015, while in   other countries there was a wide range of organisations working on mobilisations to fight climate change,   poverty and inequality.     Some stakeholders noted a big difference between mobilising for different topics and issues. A few felt that   it was difficult to engage the public around FFD as this was perceived to be a complex issue. International   Youth Day, in contrast, was a much easier and simpler topic to generate public interest for, and enabled   participating organisations to reach out to new targets and mobilise wider audiences.     5.5 BuilDing a stronger civil society movement   The third objective of the action/2015 campaign was to build a bigger, stronger movement to put pressure   on world leaders to deliver truly ambitious outcomes to end climate change, poverty and inequality in 2015,   and hold them to account in the years to come.     Action/2015 has been most successful at achieving this third objective, meeting all of the indented   outcomes, which are outlined below.        Increased   campaign   reach   among   CSOs      Increased   network   engagement   and   collaboration   to   put   pressure   on   world   leaders      Stronger   movement   ready   to   work   on   holding   leaders   to   account   in   the   years   to   come   Create a space to work together     One of the key outcomes of the action/2015 campaign is that it created a reason for CSOs in countries   around the world to cooperate, share and build networks. It created a common objective for groups to sit   together, coordinate, align their activities and strategies.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     This was the campaigns most important outcome. As discussed in Chapter 4, in some countries the   campaign built on existing coordination structures, while in others it created new coalitions and networks.   In many countries those CSOs now report an increased level of trust and a basis for working together in the   future.     I got more friends and when you have more friends you feel stronger.     Governance stakeholder, Asia     In particular, action/2015 created a space for organisations working on international development and   climate change to cooperate. Some commented that action/2015 was the first time these groups had   constructively cooperated and coordinated activities, and that was a major success of the campaign.     One interesting area where it added value was creating a constructive space for climate and poverty   groups to come together. So, for example, the climate groups were very good at calling out when texts said   development without saying sustainable development.     Governance stakeholder, global     Some commented on the importance of having an external movement such as action/2015 that all CSOs in   the country could get involved with and that was not restricted in terms of topic or themes. This created a   natural space for all types of organisations to work together.     Action/2015 gave us a platform where we could come together and create synergy. For many years it was   people doing their own things. Normally when everyone is doing their own thing wastage and duplication of   resources happened. This helped to come together and move partnerships at a national level.     Participating organisation, Africa     Action/2015 expanded participating organisations networks, both online and offline. The majority of those   who took part indicated that because of action/2015 they had connected to new people and organisations   within their own community, region or country. Some were now in touch with organisations in other   countries that were working on similar issues, sharing experiences, learning from each other and building   the foundations of potential long-term relationships.     Increase local skills and capacity     Action/2015 also increased the skills and capacity of many participating organisations. 36% of survey   respondents saw a strong increase and 43% saw some increase in capacity of local NGOs in their country.   Respondents from Spanish speaking countries reported a lower increase (13% saw a strong increase and   57% saw some increase) than respondents from other countries. Via the Google Groups and the shared   resources, action/2015 enabled organisations to see different ways of campaigning and examples from all   over the world.     In most Southern countries there is at least some experience in organising public mobilisation events on   the street. However, many stakeholders indicated that action/2105 had provided them or their organisation   with new ideas, know-how, skills and materials for campaigning. For example, the send a postcard to your   Prime Minister campaign represented a new approach for some organisations. A couple stakeholders felt   more prepared for future campaigns and are more likely to try new approaches and tools in the future.     There were lots of different levels of expertise; we saw a good progression over the course of the campaign.   That people towards end of the campaign needed less help in terms of what to do, adapting material. That   was really building capacity.     Governance stakeholder, global        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     Action/2015 also contributed to the development of skills in designing resources and campaign assets. In   emerging countries where the action/2015 movement was active such as Brazil, India and South Africa,   design agencies started developing campaigns and creative assets.     One stakeholder commented that action/2015 has contributed to taking a more fact-based approach to   developing resources. They used information from action/2015 materials to inform their stakeholders and   target audiences.     Sometimes we would go to the government with facts and information we had gotten from action/2015   emails. That is informative and it speaks positively to the leaders in the government. Sometimes CSOs are not   prepared to give facts, and action/2015 has set this precedence in terms of specific asks.     Participating organisation, Africa     5.6 influencing policy   Influencing policy as an objective of the campaign     The most contested area of this evaluation was its expected impact on policy makers and decision makers.   Many stakeholders, whether external, engaged with action/2105 at a global or local level, expressed the   view that a campaign like action/2015 cannot have real impact without influencing decision makers and   policy.     Influencing policy was not a main objective of the campaign but some felt this is the ultimate (and only)   way to change. One stakeholder stated that 2015 was a year of policy work and that using it to strengthen   civil society networks when there are so few opportunities to influence policy at the level of the UN   negotiations in New York and Paris was not the right approach.     We especially cannot separate mobilisation from advocacy … While action/2015 clearly maintained its   focus on the mobilisation side this year, we realise the limits of this approach and sincerely believe that   we would benefit from merging initiatives like Beyond2015 and action/2015 to play off each initiatives   strengths for more impact on the decision-making processes. Such a rapprochement would enable us to   strengthen CSOs mobilisation strategies through intel from advocacy, and to reinforce advocacy messages   through automatic updates on mobilisations numbers and stories that would illustrate advocacy messages   and the importance for leaders to take action.     Survey respondent     Essentially, we should have been in a partnership with the people who were doing policy such that there   was a mutual understanding that our work was helping them and opening a door to them and that the fact   that we werent taking specific policy positions didnt mean that we werent going to have a political impact.   We should have been a bit more like two sides to the same coin, with one side creating political space and the   other political content.     Participating organisation, Europe        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     On the other hand, most stakeholders understood that a campaign of the scale and breadth of action/2015   faces trade-offs, and that action/2015 had a clear focus on mobilisation.     If we had to come up with a policy framework before doing anything, we would spend ages on it and we   would lose people if we had one.     Governance stakeholder, global     Keeping it away from policy dialogue worked, in a way, because it means that everybody got involved. This   was just mobilisation, and that helped because if it was more policy-oriented then there would be so many   other organisations that would want to bring their own agenda to the table.     Participating organisation, Asia     One couldnt have ones cake and eat it. By saying it would be a loose structure, decentralised, a flotilla,   with no command of control. All that really helped ensure that the breadth was impressive and the actions   happened in a number of countries around the world without being totally centrally guided. It makes it   difficult at the same time to also be so close to political lobbying.     External stakeholder, global     Some commented that had the campaign wanted to truly shape ambitions for the SDGs, and to a lesser   extent the COP21, it should have started its work earlier and stronger. By the time that most action/2015   mobilisations around the UNGA took place the goals were already agreed upon.     Actual policy influence     In effect, action/2015 did have an impact on decision makers and policy makers, mostly on a local and   global level. As discussed in Chapter 3 some stakeholders were not aware that influencing policy makers   was not a key objective, and some smaller organisations linked mobilisation activities to engagement with   policy makers.     In general, this type of impact was strongest at a local level and on global levels, across Africa, Asia and Latin   America. Local policy makers and media were more accessible than those at a national level, and in some   countries CSOs had existing local networks and relationships.     On a national level, some coalitions pressured their leaders to attend the international negotiations and   some delegations adopted demands proposed by action/2015. Many cited examples of engagement   with policy makers, such as meeting with Ministers of Finance, the Deputy secretary, or the government   delegation for negotiations at FFD, UNGA or COP21. One stakeholder cited an example of explaining to   a key government official what the COP21 consisted of, and later seeing evidence of this conversation   repeated in a speech. Others stated examples where proposed targets and messaging for negotiations were   adopted by their countries delegation and presented at the Financing for Development summit.     Influencing officials at a national level mostly had an impact on their demands for international   negotiations. To what extent this will translate into policy at a national level remains to be see and will only   become clear when governments have started implementing the SDGs and will show whether they are   adhering to their commitments.     The UN is extremely kind as an advocacy target. You go out on the street and they invite you to come and   talk to them. Governments are the opposite.     Governance stakeholder, global        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     On a global level, impact on the UN was perceived to be strong. The presence of vocal CSOs throughout the   negotiations gave a sense that the world is watching. Both global level and external stakeholders indicated   that the unity and cooperation of civil society had a significant impact on UN negotiations, especially the   SDGs. Some participating organisations stated they were pleased with the way their cause / issue was   represented in the SDGs, and attributed this success partly to the action/2015 campaign.     We needed civil society to come together, collaborate, have that level of collaboration like we havent had   in the past. That carried through in the negotiations, the entire weekend. Civil society was there the whole   time.     External stakeholder, global     ….Older people and ageing issues got included in the SDGs! It was not only me and action/2015, but   many people across the world. But finally out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, in almost 15 you can   incorporate ageing issues.     Governance stakeholder, Asia     As noted by a couple stakeholders, it is important to put mobilisation and its effect on policy influence in   perspective. One stakeholder stated that in a lot of countries in the Global South going out and marching   on the street is not a way to raise attention anymore; for example India was asked to deliver big numbers for   mobilisations, and they did so, but having 800,000 people on the street doesnt have a lot of impact in India   anymore. These stakeholders suggested that the type of mobilisation that action/2015 did does not have a   long-term impact on policy makers.     Mobilisation that really changes policy decisions, is not the kind that action/2015 was doing. Governments   listen to sustained, ongoing mobilisation, they do not listen to one day of people coming and dancing on the   street.     Governance stakeholder, global        FUTURE: STAkEHOLDER VIEWS ON THE FUTURE       6.1 introDuction   Action/2015 has formally come to an end, and there are many views on its future, next steps and on how   action/2015 should build on the momentum and enthusiasm built throughout the campaign. This chapter   discusses stakeholders views on these points.     6.2 vieWs on the future of the campaign   Most stakeholders had considered the future of action/2015 and had clearly given thought to the followup   for the campaign. Many felt that action/2015 showed the possibilities and opportunities of a loosely   coordinated global campaign. They saw it as important to build on this momentum and to sustain the   energy that was created during action/2015.     Theres an appetite right now to talk about joint campaigning. Going forward, whats next? Action/2015   showed that it can happen and that it works. Its a way that civil society can loosely coordinate a campaign.   Of course theres reticence by some that dont want to loose their identities and exactly what they stand   for. But then theres a readiness to form different networks and groupings, because action/2015 basically   emerged from a discussion between different campaigning networks and then it went to mobilising activists   and civil society organisations around the world…. There is a need for a global movement to continue and I   think action/2015 played a clear role in reassuring people that this could happen.     External stakeholder, global     Many felt that this should not be done under the action/2015 brand. Some indicated it is a pity to stop   using a name and logo that have built up considerable awareness and recognition in a relatively short   period of time. However, many feel that action/2015 was designed for one year and should adhere to its   intended lifetime.     Action2015 should not make the mistake of prolonging its own existence. It is not designed as a long-term   campaign. It was designed as a call to action and has fulfilled its purpose.     Governance stakeholder, global     Some felt that action/2015 could have improved planning for the future at an earlier stage, and pointed   out that using a name that is linked to the year 2015 rules out options to extend its mandate or use existing   resources. One stakeholder indicated that action/2015 could have improved its data strategy. It should have   designed a platform or other ways to communicate with participating organisations and others that were   involved in the campaign after its formal end in December 2015.     A majority of stakeholders indicated they planned to continue working on action/2015 themes and issues.   73% of survey respondents plans to keep using elements of the campaign in the future. A large majority   expect constituents or beneficiaries to keep engaging in civil society activities to hold leaders to account, as   is shown in the graph below.        FUTURE: STAkEHOLDER VIEWS ON THE FUTURE      Survey responses on continued work on holding leaders to account     Do you expect your constituents/ beneficiaries to keep engaging in   civil society activities to hold leaders to account in 2016?         As illustrated in the case studies, a number of countries stated they had already started follow-up   conversations and were planning for the future, building on existing action/2015 structures. Most   stakeholders indicated that the relationships and networks that have been built through action/2015 will   continue in the future and will lead to long-term cooperation.     The relationships that we have established through action/2015 will continue.     Participating organisation, Africa     Many stakeholders, especially those working at a national level, noted that the most important issues   for the future will be the accountability framework for national governments. Tracking progress on the   implementation of the negotiations and ensuring governments adhere to the targets they committed to   in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris is seen as essential. Some specified the key focus for this work, which   would include research to identify gaps in national policies that enable the SDGs to be delivered, further   awareness raising and mobilisation, and monitoring and evaluation.     A couple of stakeholders made suggestions on how action/2015 could build on the momentum of the   campaign. These included linking reporting mechanisms to the key dates of the three negotiations   that were held in 2015, and establishing a yearly progress report for every country. Another suggested   campaigning in the next phase should have a stronger theme-based focus or a renewed focus on building   civil society capacity at a national level.     Most stakeholders indicate that lack of funding and resources is the biggest barrier to continued   engagement with these issues. A couple mention other reasons like a loss of momentum, a lack of renewed   focus and lack of messaging and tailored tools.     Other campaigns that action/2015 participating organisations are working on or will be involved with in the   future include: GCAP coalitions, So now what, Together 2030 and activities from the climate movement.   Many stakeholders express the need to think about the future of the movement and how best to carry   forward the enthusiasm, Southern leadership and momentum built by the campaign.     What an incredible movement to have been a part of! A truly inspirational campaign that brought together   a diverse set of individuals and organisations with a unique passion and drive for protecting people and   planet. It was a real honour and a privilege to have been a part action/2015.     Survey respondent       CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED       7.1 introDuction   This chapter synthesises the findings of this report into final conclusions, recommendations and lessons   learned. It includes lessons for the future of the action/2015 network and to inform the design of future civil   society coordination mechanisms.     It consists of chapter 7.2 on key conclusions, chapter 7.3 on recommendations for the action/2015 coalition   and future global campaigns and chapter 7.4 on key lessons learned.     7.2 conclusions   In many ways, action/2015 was a transitional campaign. It can be seen as both the last of an old   generation of global campaigns and the first of a new generation. It looked to the future in being strongly   rooted in the Global South. It was collaborative, inclusive and owned by its participating organisations.   However, it was still a campaign primarily designed and funded by Northern funders and NGOs.     The campaign met the expectations of participating organisations for the year. It informed and   mobilised the public about the importance of the international negotiations in 2015 and, most successfully,   built a stronger movement of CSOs. The campaign showed that with a limited amount of central funding it   is possible to meaningfully inspire civil society across the world.     The key impact of the campaign was that global civil society groups learned how to work together.     Action/2015 was characterised by a high level of enthusiasm, sharing and cooperation among participating   organisations, especially when compared to previous global campaigns and coalitions. There is a high level   of enthusiasm among those in the coalition to keep working together.     Action/2015 laid the groundwork for long-term impact, especially in terms of connecting national   agendas and government policy to global policy frameworks. The campaign was explicitly designed for   public mobilisation and long-term change in CSO networks, and had less focus on policy impact in the year.   This is something that participating organisations are keen to build on in the future. The campaign has   shown there is real public constituency for the SDGs. It provided a basis for long-term commitment from   younger generations and new audiences, inspiring a new generation of activists.     Action/2015 took meaningful steps towards Southern ownership of a global campaign. This was   something it had explicitly set out to do in its objectives. Funding and setup of the early governance of   the campaign came from Northern funders and NGOs, but as the year progressed Southern organisations   became more involved. While the original participation in governance felt symbolic for many, by the time   the coalition was functional, most felt Southern engagement in leadership was meaningful. Levels of   perceived Southern ownership were high. Powerful Southern voices emerged through the process.     One of the key achievements of the campaign was that it created a space for climate and   development groups to work together. This is an important achievement. Across the coalition, the   number of CSOs working on development was higher than those working on climate, and there were fewer   strong climate-focused actors, but the connections made across issues appear meaningful and lasting.     Overall, the flotilla approach was fit for purpose. The campaign showed the benefits of leveraging   resources through coalition and partnership and of campaigning under one global brand. Participating   organisations tested new tools and approaches to engage their communities and were positive about their   experiences. Much of the feedback on campaign design and delivery is that it wasnt enough localised or   adjusted to local context, but in some ways this reflected local capacity and resources to adapt globally   provided resources.        CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED     Globally, the campaign did not engage with non-NGO civil society actors, such as faith groups and   trades union, as successfully as it could have done. There is no reason this could not have happened,   given the design and objectives of the campaign. Most expected these actors would take part in the   campaign. The coalition could have been stronger if they were included, but this was not a priority in   the planning. It should be prioritised in planning for future campaigns. Action/2015 was more open for   engagement with the private sector than previous coalitions and had some links at a local and national   level, but this was not extensive.     Some noted the absence of other big global NGOs in the coalition. This was automatically assumed to be   a weakness, but whilst it would have added additional resources, it would also have added complexity to   the governance of the campaign at a central level. It also may have challenged the emerging Southern   leadership. The impact of this absence is unclear.     There is a strong case for maintaining some of the action/2015 structures and networks. The practical   task of initiating global structures is always likely to be taken on by those with the greatest access and   resources. The members of the network established through the year should consider how best to carry   forward the Southern leadership and mobilisation achieved by action/2015.     7.3 recommenDations   Recommendations for members of the action/2015 coalition     Action/2015 should build on what it has achieved. It has created a platform for future collaboration. We   make four recommendations for the members of the action/2015 campaign:     1. Members of action/2015 should keep the network alive. It has created a platform for   organisations to collaborate, rather than a single global movement of individual citizens. It has   created real local mobilisation capacity in new places. There needs to be infrastructure for on-going   knowledge sharing, coordination and planning, carrying forward the objectives and Southern led   ownership of the campaign, building on the enthusiasm to work together.   2. Members of action/2015 should identify and plan for moments to come together as a global   network. These could have a thematic focus or could be linked to key mobilisation moments from   the 2015 campaigning year. These moments should have a forward calendar where key moments   will be identified. The coalition needs to think about how these moments will be resourced.   3. Campaigners should consider how they will hold their governments to account. National   governments made real commitments in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris. Members of the   coalition should connect national policy and performance to these commitments, and consider   them in a local context. This will require a focus on policy monitoring and evaluation, gathering   data on implementation and moments to hold governments to account.   4. The coalition should keep building an inclusive network. It should explore broadening the   network to include those civil society actors that were not part of the original campaign, and invest   in existing relationships between participating organisations.   Recommendations for future global campaigns     Action/2015 appears to have triggered a new enthusiasm for global coalition working. We make four   recommendations for those seeking to build similar global structures in the future:     1. Global campaigns should focus on mobilisation over policy when the objective is   demonstrating broad public pressure for political change. It is an inclusive approach that   requires wide participation and high level messaging. The trade offs are accountability, specificity   and a limited call to action. The decentralised flotilla is an appropriate model for certain types   of campaigning. There is no central bottleneck to action, limited sign-off processes, and a lot of   self-organising communication across the campaign. It may prove challenging for this model   to accommodate more detailed policy and advocacy work without creative thinking about new   approaches.      CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED     2. Global campaigns in the future will be most effective when they can connect across issues,   and empower new voices. They must be led by a diverse set of actors rooted in the Global South.   Action/2015 was transitional in the sense that it marked an important step on this journey. The next   generation of global campaigning should build on its achievements. This implies that NGOs and   their funders need to continue to reflect on their fundamental role in society, how they represent   power, their legitimacy and added value.   3. Global campaigns should be as inclusive as possible, and prioritise this early on in campaign   design. Meaningful coalition building happens when a campaign includes a wide spectrum   of non-NGO civil society actors. There is no reason not to include wider non-NGO civil society   groups at a global level with a platform of this kind. There should be more creative thinking   about engaging with the private sector. The emergence of social enterprises, B Corps, mutual   organisations and co-operatives shows that the line between the private sector and civil society is   increasingly opaque.   4. Internally, there may be value in under-promising and over-delivering when planning,   designing and communicating coalitions. This is counter-intuitive to many in campaigning, who   seek to inspire with impossible objectives. However, many interviewees close to the centre of the   coalition expressed relatively low expectations for the campaign, and exceeding these has left   people ready to do more. It also created the space for people in national campaigns to set their   own expectations. This may not always be appropriate for external communications, but it is an   area worth further consideration.   7.4 lessons learneD   Action/2015 offered a number of general lessons for global campaigners. These lessons can inform best   practices for global campaigns and civil society coordination mechanisms.     1. Decentralise but with central capacity: the structure of a loosely coordinated flotilla campaign   can function well, enabling participating organisations to choose those issues most suitable to   them and not being governed by a central authority. However, basic campaign functions like   communications and fundraising should be globally coordinated, trickling down to a national level,   and therefore need central capacity and resources. People matter, and having human resources at a   global level that can build trust, connect and inspire engagement and cooperation is invaluable.   2. The more local, the better: Local languages, faces, issues and wording ensure the campaign is   grounded in peoples everyday reality and inspire stronger engagement and commitment to the   campaign. Resources and campaign materials will be more effective the more they can be aligned   or adapted to local reality (this includes using editable design-formats).   3. Build on existing structures: In many countries and regions, existing coordination structures,   networks and partner coalitions are the best way to build a global campaign. It works well and   leverages the strength of existing networks and relationships. Action/2015 did this in some   countries like India and Mexico, but could have increased the use of existing structures on a   national and regional level. Global campaigners should actively seek out opportunities to identify   and use these existing networks.   4. Invest in national coordination: Strong national coordination can lead to increased impact and   reach. The following factors improved functioning of national coalitions during the action/2015   campaign:      Leveraging   national   networks   and   partnership   structures      A   strong   full   time   coordinator   that   can   dedicate   time   and   resources   to   the   campaign   and   does   not have to balance interests of a host organisation        Engagement   with   young   people   leads   to   broader   reach   and   involvement   of   new   groups      A   high   level   of   funding   enables   national   coalitions   to   strengthen   resourcing,   increase   capacity   and invest in coalition building        CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED     5. Early engagement and wide engagement makes a difference: Include as many organisations,   individuals, views and opinions as early as possible if you want to design a truly global, inclusive   and decentralised campaign. Southern organisations need to take part not only in the delivery, but   also in the very first stages of the design, ensuring they not only get a seat at the table, but can lead   the discussion.   We need to invest time, money and emotional intelligence in building global movements.     Survey respondent     6. Plan, plan, plan and reflect: When designing a global campaign it is important to start planning   early and ensure timelines allow enough time for reflection. A campaign full of activities   throughout the year inspires enthusiasm, but also mobilisation fatigue and rush. It is important   to allow enough time to learn from the past, plan, share and review before the delivery actually   happens. Fewer, bigger moments may be more effective than spreading effort too thinly.   An imaginative, innovative approach that is not resource heavy can contribute greatly to creating   awareness and also bring in a lot of energy and enthusiasm.     Survey respondent     7. Consider trade-offs around messaging: It is important to consider the trade-offs between high   level messaging and specific, targeted messaging. High level messaging enables participation of a   wide range of groups and can foster a climate of cooperation and sharing. It enables organisations   to take part in a campaign working on issues aligned to an organisations themes and issues.   However, specific asks often have increased political impact and present a stronger call to action.   Future campaigners should consider the trade-offs between different types of messaging and its   effect on campaign participation and impact   8. A united civil society is influential: Action/2015 provided strong evidence that when civil society   cooperates and works together it has a powerful voice. Between local, national, regional and global   networks civil society organisations have a tremendous network and mobilising millions of people   across the world sends a clear message. Additionally, being able to speak to a united civil society   fosters engagement with decision makers as it is much easier to speak to one representative voice   The most important lessons learned from action/2015? First, there is strength in numbers. Second,   working in consortia is advantageous and third, funding many organisations, no matter how small, yield   great results.     Survey respondent     9. Evaluation is information: When designing a campaign ensure that you make optimal use of the   feedback of its participants, and that tracking, monitoring and evaluation is set up consistently   and thoroughly. Some also suggested that action/2015 could have benefited from increased   options to share campaign materials and evidence (photos, videos). A more coherent approach to   evaluation and monitoring optimises outcomes from campaign reviews and evaluations. However,   a decentralised approach makes a necessary trade-off in terms of the data that can be collated   centrally.   10. Mobilisation is a means, political change is the end: Raising awareness of the opportunities of   2015 and mobilising millions of people to take action is important, but it is only a means to an end.   The ultimate (and only) way to real change is to influence policy makers and decision makers, and   a global campaign should mobilise people in service of policy change, with a continuous exchange   of information. It should strengthen mobilisation strategies with input from advocacy and support   advocacy with evidence and messaging from mobilisation.   Giving politicians a sense that this wasnt just a UN process is a gift that will give again.
