CLIMATE CROWD
ON THE GROUND
A COMPILATION OF CLIMATE CROWD PROJECTS


The voice of rural communities is frequently missing from mainstream climate science, even though they are all on the front lines of climate change. This was the motivation to create Climate Crowd, which first got started in 2014, with the idea to crowdsource data on how communities were being impacted by and responding to changes in weather and climate. Often, communities are already coping with these impacts, sometimes in ways that can be harmful to nature. Climate Crowd learns from their experiences, captures their stories, and helps them with practical, nature-compatible ways to deal with their challenges. Often, the solutions are shaped by a community's own traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.
From humble beginnings, with a $30,000 grant from WWF innovation funds, Climate Crowd has grown to include data from over 30 countries and 15 on-the-ground projects in 8 countries to date, with data collection and on-the-ground projects planned across many more sites over the coming year. The Climate Crowd methodology is to provide training and guidance to local partners who work with communities to collect data using a key informant survey. The Climate Crowd team then analyzes the data, compiling summary reports that highlight key trends. The findings are then presented back to the communities, and we work with them to co-design and implement on-the-ground projects to address climate vulnerabilities using funding from Climate Crowd.
As the climate changes and communities adapt, Climate Crowd wants to help them do so in ways that benefit both people and nature. The number of partners we work with and the geographies we work in is growing rapidly, and I encourage you to check in regularly at wwfclimatecrowd.org. I am indebted to many Climate Crowd partners over the years for all the fantastic work detailed in the following pages, including the communities, funders, NGO partners, and many others. I would also like to acknowledge Annika Bowman and Rebecca Snyder for all their efforts in compiling this publication.
Yours sincerely,

ACTIVITIES
Participatory planning: Stakeholders chose a parcel of degraded land bordering the Black Lion Tamarin Ecological Station for reforestation. Hiring of local contractors to conduct soil preparation using plowing, sorting and manual removal of grasses/other exotic species. Capacity building: Project organizers conducted lectures and training workshops in communities bordering the protected area. Materials: Sourcing of seeds including both native and fast-growing pioneer species from local nurseries. Reforestation: Through community mobilization, seedlings were planted at the start of the rainy season and spaced 6.5 feet apart, with 8 feet between each row Participatory monitoring: Project staff and stakeholders tracked the growth of planted trees and conducted maintenance, including site visits to perform ant control, prevent invasion of grasses and replant more than 200 trees to replace those that did not survive.

PROJECT DESIGN
The Pontal do Paranapanema region has grown hotter and drier in recent years, making it difficult to grow crops and find sufficient food for livestock. Wildlife are also feeling the effects , with more venturing onto farms in absence of suitable habitat. WWF and the Institute for Ecological Research (IPE) joined forces to restore a local watershed and improve habitat connectivity through community-based reforestation. Once mature, a newly planted tropical forest will provide direct benefits to people such as water provision services, decreased damage from wind storms, carbon sequestration and protection from soil degradation. The new forest will also serve as an important habitat corridor for local wildlife, including the endangered black lion tamarin, as well as ocelots, jaguars, monkeys, and armadillos, and create a buffer zone for The Black Lion Tamarin Ecological Station.

While households in San Bartolome Jocotenango lack access to irrigation, piped water is available for household use such as drinking, cooking, cleaning, etc. With rainfall dwindling, and crops suffering as a result, community members in collaboration with a Peace Corps volunteer designed a project to establish greywater filtration systems that enable users to safely and efficiently re-use water to irrigate home garden plots. This intervention will ensure that farmers have a consistent supply of water regardless of rainfall, and help to conserve water thereby reducing pressure on other sources of freshwater.
ACTIVITIES
Initial project planning and design. Construction of two greywater filtration systems: The systems consist of two concrete basins used to capture greywater, and layers of charcoal, ash, sand and rock, that filter debris in combination with nitrogenating plants. The filtered water is collected in a large barrel and connected to a drip irrigation system on the property, where it is used to grow vegetables. Construction of three additional systems in Las Cuevas and Chota'aj communities.

Seaweed farming requires buoys and rope of various sizes and lengths. Provide market access for the sale of products to the private sector
Did you know?
In addition to being a resilient source of income for coastal communities, seaweed farming has a number of environmental benefits. Seaweed can help mitigate climate change by storing carbon. It can also reduce local effects of ocean acidification and improve oxygen levels.

PROJECT DESIGN

With agricultural production declining due to drought, people are relying more heavily on fishing, placing greater pressure on already strained fisheries. This project establishes seaweed farming and beekeeping to help households diversify their income and lessen the burden on marine ecosystems. Seaweed farming will be primarily driven by local women, facilitating women's involvement in income-generating activities.

PROJECT OUTCOMES
Increased household income from alternative livelihoods
Reduced pressure on fisheries
32 households involved in beekeeping
42 households involved in seaweed farming
Increased involvement of women in incomegenerating activities

PROJECT DESIGN
Facing temperature extremes, erratic rainfall, and pests, families in Santa Lucia need locallyled adaptation interventions that reduce their vulnerability to climate change. Through this project, a local Peace Corps volunteer and teachers from a nearby school worked together to develop a curriculum and instruct middle and high school students and the broader community on climate science and how to develop interventions that boost local resilience to the effects of climate change. The project aimed to help the youth of Santa Lucia in project planning and management while exposing them to local environmental issues. Students learned how to implement adaptation projects, such as smallscale greenhouses and xeriscaped gardens, to give them practical tools for creating more climate-resilient communities.

Workshops: Project leaders instructed three groups of middle school students and one group of high school students on the basics of climate science and impacts. Instruction was also provided on how to plan and execute local adaptation projects. Homework: Students wrote reports on their respective projects, sourced project materials from their homes and communities like bottles, rope, etc. and made "eco-bricks." Pilot projects at the school: Students helped construct hoop gardens, xeriscaped gardens, and eco benches.
Hoop gardens are a small-scale and inexpensive type of greenhouse. They use PVC tubing or rods and greenhouse film to cover garden beds, which helps protect plants from freezing temperatures, heavy rainfall, and insects. Xeriscape gardening is a type of landscaping technique suitable for arid climates that uses rocks and plants that require minimal water to survive. Eco-benches were built using "ecobricks" made of plastic bottles filled with non-recyclable or noncompostable refuse from homes, schools and public spaces. Pilot projects in communities: upon completion of hoop garden at the school, six teams of high school students led the construction of hoop gardens in their respective communities

PROJECT DESIGN

Stakeholder consultation: Introductory meetings were held with local indigenous authorities to present the project and collect baseline information (land use maps, soil type, agriculture techniques used, crop type, production and productivity). Site selection: Treatment and control plots were selected based on suitability of the land, willingness of owners to participate, and suggestions made by municipal authorities. Technical design: Fog catchers and water channel systems were designed based on consultations with experts in soil health, agriculture and engineering. Fog catcher installation: EECO conducted a workshop with selected farmers to introduce the project, provide training on installing fog catchers, and complete installation. Water channel construction: A second workshop was held on water channel construction. Monitoring and evaluation: EECO monitored the functioning of water channels and fog catchers and compared crop survival in treatment plots to control plots.

PROJECT OUTCOMES
Four fog catchers and ten artifical waterways constructed
20 volunteers from the local community trained on fog catcher and water channel construction
95% plant survival rate on treated plots, compared to just 25% on control plots

Farmers in Santa Maria Yucahiti were sowing crops on the edge of nearby forests, which offered protection from worsening drought and cold snaps that had decimated crops in recent years. However, the use of "slash and burn" farming near forests resulted in two fires that went out of control, damaging close to 40 acres of primary forest. To improve crop survival and reduce adverse impacts on forests, WWF funded an innovative project in partnership with Espacio de Encuentro de Culturas Orinarias (EECO), a local NGO, to install fog catchers and artificial water channels surrounding crops. Fog catchers collect water from the atmosphere during periods of drought and feed into the water channels, which in turn, create a micro-climate that reduces frost-related crop damage and maintains soil moisture.

PROJECT DESIGN
The village of Idunda is experiencing increasingly unpredictable rainfall, placing greater strain on the village's only groundwater outlet, which serves over half of Idunda residents. To improve local water security and hygiene, a local Peace Corps volunteer teamed up with teachers, students and families from the community to construct a rain capture and storage system and new hand washing station at Idunda's primary school. The rain catchment system diverts roof runoff to a water storage tank and any overflow to an infiltration pond to minimize soil erosion and replenish groundwater. The stored water is piped to the hand washing station located between the bathrooms and classrooms such that students can conveniently wash their hands before returning to class. Following construction and installation, teachers led a School Water Day, during which students participated in hands-on activities to learn about climate change, water conservation, and appropriate use of water for personal health and hygiene.

ACTIVITIES
Community Action Planning: Following a participatory appraisal, community members and project facilitators wrote a community action plan (CAP) for project implementation. Surveying of water resources: Water resource engineers surveyed fourteen water sources to determine usage rates - and technical feasibility. Only those that benefited the community most were selected for repair. Water source committees: users of each water source met to establish management plans, including a system of fee collection to fund future repairs Improvement of water resources: Project facilitators developed plans to move agricultural activities away from water sources, build protective barriers around wells, plant native trees and shrubs to reduce sedimentation, and remove contaminants.

PROJECT OUTCOMES
4 newly protected water sources

PROJECT DESIGN

Through a participatory rural appraisal, community mapping and development of seasonal calendars, the community of Kihigwa, with the help of a local Peace Corps volunteer, identified water insecurity as a critical climate change impact affecting community members. This project set out to repair existing wells and implement measures to protect four open springs from evaporation during droughts and contamination from increased storm runoff. The project also helps address other challenges identified by the community, including health issues, agricultural output and gender equity. Improvement of water resources will reduce water-borne illness, provide water for farm irrigation, and reduce the amount of time spent collecting and purifying water, a responsibility primarily shouldered by women.

The Ichupa Upcycle Project is in the process of becoming a registered community-based organization.
ACTIVITIES
Identification of tank locations: Sites were chosen based on need, access, and security. Preparation of construction sites: Stakeholders cleared sites of weeds and debris, leveled off the land where necessary, and built bases to support the tanks. Procurement and preparation of plastic bottles: Project partners held a community clean-up day to gather plastic bottles. Children from a local school helped pack bottles with dirt, small pebbles and plastic. Tank construction: for each tank, bottles were arranged in a circle with the caps facing outward. Cement was applied between bottles and between each layer. Gutter installation: Once tanks were completed, gutters were added to nearby buildings and attached to the tanks.

PROJECT DESIGN
According to interviews with Mbale residents, rainfall is no longer consistent and has led to widespread water insecurity with severe consequences for farmers. Designed and led by former Peace Corps volunteer Michal Matejczuk, the Ichupa Upcycle project uses discarded plastic bottles collected from the community as raw material for constructing rainwater harvesting systems that can store water for use during dry spells. The project also contributes to local capacity-building by bringing together different project beneficiaries, designing solutions, sourcing funding, procuring plastic bottles, and ensure the timely completion of all activites.

PROJECT DESIGN
In recent years, Mayuge district residents have experienced long periods of drought

and excessive heat, punctuated by extreme rainfall and accompanying soil erosion. These changes have had devastating effects in a society where nearly 90% of people make a living through rain-fed agriculture. In response to water insecurity and poor crop yields, WWF teamed up with a Peace Corps volunteer, Sam Strimling, to support a community-wide effort to construct a much-needed irrigation system to support local farms. This project provided the community with the materials and training needed to build underground storage tanks to collect and filter runoff during heavy rainfall, and store it safely for use during prolonged dry spells.
ACTIVITIES
Irrigation site selection: The initial construction site was chosen based on proven need and collective farming capacity. Construction of irrigation system: Nearly 200 community members worked to construct an irrigation system consisting of a large water storage tank, an attached smaller tank for filtering sediment, a pipe used to capture run-off from the existing borehole, a gas-powered water pump, and a 150-meter hose to distribute water to the crops. Knowledge-sharing: Project partners invited community members from nearby regional zones to observe and participate in irrigation system construction to encourage widespread adoption.

PROJECT OUTCOMES

As climate change intensifies, access to accurate weather information is vital to ensuring food security. With shifting seasonal, temperature and rainfall patterns, automated weather stations allow farmers to better plan planting and harvesting dates. So far, Climate Crowd has installed automated weather stations in 8 countries, providing farmers and local wildlife authorities with reliable weather information.

In Hwange district, a shift to hotter, drier conditions has decimated crops and livestock, and reduced access to freshwater. Some have found alternative sources of income through brick-making and wood carving, placing greater pressure on local forests. In partnership with Greenline Africa, a local NGO, this project improves water security by installing a rainwater harvesting system, upgrading a borehole pump to solar power, and installing improved irrigation, and reduces pressure on forests through installation of clean cookstoves. Additionally, the project set a goal of 60/40 female to male participation, established a women's cooperative to help scale up project activities, and is monitoring changes in time spent collecting water (currently 23hrs), a responsibility primarily shouldered by women.
