Introduction


While the international community has struggled to curtail greenhouse gas
emissions, forests around the world have been buying us time to transition to
clean, renewable-energy economies. Forests act as giant carbon vaults, storing
away in their wood, leaves, and soil more carbon than is found in all currently
accessible coal, oil, and gas reserves combined.1 Forests also continuously add
to this carbon vault and in recent decades have absorbed nearly one-third of the
greenhouse gases we release each year.2 The global scientific community has made
it clear we must limit warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (C) in order to
avoid the worst impacts of climate change,3 and that doing so will require not just
ending our reliance on fossil fuels, but also protecting intact and primary forests’
ability to store and absorb carbon.4

The Canadian boreal forest, which comprises a quarter                and its representatives are overselling the forest’s capacity

  INTACT AND PRIMARY FORESTS
  Not all forests are created equal, and intact and primary forests, terms that are used interchangeably in this paper to mean forests that are free
  of any significant human footprint,40 have far greater biodiversity and climate value than forests that have been degraded by industry.41 These
  forests develop over a long period, as species of plants, animals, and fungi interact and form complex relationships across decades and even
  centuries.42 (The term “old growth” forest, sometimes used to refer to primary and intact forests, has no standard definition and is therefore not
  used in this paper.)
  Protecting intact and primary forests, especially under the leadership of Indigenous Peoples, is essential to combating climate change43 and
  is, in fact, one of the cheapest and most technologically feasible climate solutions.44 These forests contain a diversity of species and habitats
  that is missing in areas that have been logged or impacted by other industries such as mining and oil and gas.45 They also typically store more
  carbon than their degraded counterparts,46 and they can be more resilient to natural disturbances like fires,47 which is increasingly important
  as climate impacts worsen.

  BOREAL CARIBOU
  Boreal caribou, the iconic species emblazoned on Canada’s quarter, have been federally listed as “threatened” since 200353 and are declining
  across Canada at a rate of 30 percent every 18 years.54 Boreal caribou depend on intact forests for their survival,55 and human-caused habitat
  disturbance, principally due to industrial logging, is their primary threat.56 Today only 15 of Canada’s 51 boreal caribou herds are self-sustaining
  for the long term given the level of disturbance to their habitat.57 Further, caribou are an indicator species, meaning that a population’s decline
  signals broader concerns in the forest ecosystem.58 The condition of this species is thus a proxy not only for the forest’s climate value59 but
  also for logging’s impact on other species.60

                                         Wildfires have been integral to the boreal forest’s ecological health since time immemorial. As wildfires become more frequent and more
                                         extreme, industry often claims that logging thins the forest and prevents wildfires from raging out of control. However, this argument deflects
                                         attention from logging's overall ecological impacts and omits the fact that, in the face of wildfires, protecting intact forests only becomes more
                                         urgent.93
                                         While some forestry activities can be helpful in reducing the frequency of fires,94 intensive logging practices like clearcutting and second-
                                         growth forests are often associated with more frequent and intense blazes.95 In addition, in terms of ecological disturbance, fires are not
                                         biologically, chemically, or structurally equivalent to clearcut logging.96 Typical wildfires burn off less than a quarter of the total biomass, and
                                         much of the resulting dead wood continues to store carbon97 or is converted to charcoal, which has an average age in the soil of 600 to 2,000
                                         years.98 By contrast, clearcut logging removes almost all of a region’s trees for conversion into products with far shorter life spans.
                                         Furthermore, the climate-caused increase in fires is not occurring uniformly across Canada, meaning that an argument that logging will reduce
                                         wildfires would be irrelevant in some areas. This is especially true in the eastern boreal forest, which has avoided the large-scale fires that
                                         dominated the summer and fall news cycles in Canada in recent years.99 Models forecasting climate change impacts show that this trend will

                                         in the east, where a significant percentage of boreal logging occurs—as critical bastions for carbon and biodiversity in a changing climate.

Harvested Wood Product (HWP), it retains only a fraction of its
original carbon—as little as 15 percent.ix However, much of the
wood from Canada is instead turned into paper or throwaway
tissue products, which are even less effective at retaining
carbon. When the wood is burned for biofuel, all its carbon is
emitted.x As an HWP ages, it continues to emit its remaining
carbon.xi When it is discarded in a landfill, it begins emitting
both carbon and methane.xii
