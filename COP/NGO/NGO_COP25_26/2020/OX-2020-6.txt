* E very year all Oxfam affiliates, including Oxfam GB, are required to complete a global report which details how many people each affiliate has reached.
   This includes the number of people by country, region and global programme type. We have highlighted the deduplicated and rounded number of people
   reached directly by Oxfam GB where we are ‘executing affiliate’ within the wider Oxfam confederation.
2019/20 highlights at a glance
• Working with our partners to reach over 800,000 people whose lives were affected by Cyclone Idai in
    Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi.
• Collaborating with The Humanitarian Innovation Fund to design, field test and manufacture a unique
    new handwashing station for emergencies, which we plan to roll out internationally.
• Maintaining 52% of our work around the world with women, helping to fight the discrimination that
    keeps people poor.

Where our income came
from in 2019/20
Oxfam GB’s total 2019/20 income was £367.4m, a decrease
of £66.7m (15.4%) on the previous year’s record level. This
was expected for several reasons. Firstly, we benefited from
a one-off, exceptional level of legacy income (£54.4m) in
2018/19. By comparison, legacy income in 2019/20 (£17.6m)
was more in line with the historical average. Secondly, direct
funding of Oxfam GB by the EU is in decline due to Brexit with
applications increasingly being handled by our fellow Oxfam
European affiliates. Thirdly, funding from the UK government
has been impacted by our previous voluntary withdrawal from
the DFID bidding process during the Charity Commission’s
statutory inquiry. Finally, our humanitarian appeals income
was £1.6m in 2019/20 compared to £6.4m in 2018/19.

Total income less expenditure
For Oxfam GB, long run total income should broadly align with total expenditure. However, due to inevitable timing
differences in the arrival of income and the incurring of expenditure, we may report either a surplus or a deficit of
income over expenditure in any particular year. This is possible thanks to the reserves we carry which ensure that we
can keep our work with people facing poverty going even under unexpected circumstances. In 2018/19 we reported a
surplus of income over expenditure of £36.7m whilst in 2019/20 expenditure exceeded income by £17.0m as illustrated
by the chart below.

Our effectiveness
Since 2011, Oxfam GB has been conducting impact
evaluations of individual projects. These are known as
‘Effectiveness Reviews’. These evaluations help Oxfam
GB to continuously evolve its work to have the greatest
impact possible, and to understand and evidence
whether its work is resulting in positive change.
We are able to evaluate our impact across entire thematic
areas of our work, not just individual projects. We look at
areas such as women’s empowerment, sustainable water,
resilience to the effects of climate change, and more. For

are showing, visit www.oxfam.org.uk/effectiveness

Significant risks
Oxfam GB works in challenging environments and has developed an approach to risk management that allows it respond to risks
and adapt how it operates. At the time of this report, the extent of uncertainty in our operating environment has never been
greater. A number of the uncertainties set out below are inherent to the mission of Oxfam GB and present both risks to be managed
and opportunities to improve both what we do and how we deliver our work. In some cases, grasping opportunities will help us to
shift power and resources to the global South and local partners.

Grant Making policies
In 2019/20, we spent £71.2m (2018/19: £77.5m) in
grants to international, national and local partner
organisations. We made 653 grants to 481 organisations
(2018/19: 713 grants to 486 organisations). The average
grant per project was £109,000 (2018/19: £109,000)
and per partner was £148,000 (2018/19: £159,000).
Oxfam GB works with and through others to take action
to achieve common goals for overcoming poverty and
injustice based on complementarity and respect for the
contribution that each party brings. Oxfam GB’s partner
relations are informed by, and managed to, a set of clear
principles. These five principles underpin our programme
and partnership decisions in development, humanitarian
and campaigns work at every level of activity. We hold
ourselves accountable to these principles and seek to
be held accountable by partners, communities and other
stakeholders with whom we and our partners work.

    ** It is not appropriate to split support costs between activities undertaken directly and grant funding of activities due to the dual role played by programme support functions.

i.  Activities undertaken directly
    Oxfam’s own overseas staff are involved in the delivery of the programme through the provision of specialist services (e.g. to address the water and sanitation needs of
    refugees) and through training and networking for local organisations. Included in ‘Charitable activities’ are all the in-country costs associated with programme delivery and
    monitoring of grants made to partner organisations (e.g. direct programme costs, logistics, finance, human resources, and programme management). This provides an
    accurate reflection of the true costs of our activities and support to those activities.

    The staff numbers for Oxfam only are the same as above except that Trading includes 83 (2018/19: 93) OAL staff and Overseas payroll includes 62 (2018/19: 61) staff for Finance
    for Development Ltd and 30 (2018/19: 30) staff for Frip Ethique SARL.							
    Oxfam’s employment policies encourage a range of working patterns including job sharing and part-time working. These can result in a significantly lower number of employees
    when based on full-time equivalents rather than on headcount.

    Total staff costs for Oxfam only are the same as above except that overseas payroll staff costs includes £0.6m (2018/19: £0.5m) for Finance for Development Ltd and £0.1m
    (2018/19: £0.1m) for Frip Ethique SARL.
    Termination costs, included above, amounted to £1.4m (2018/19: £2.1m), of which £0.6m (2018/19: £0.8m) was provided for at year-end.
    Staff costs are allocated according to the functions of each staff member and, therefore, form part of trading costs, fundraising costs, governance costs, and charitable
    expenditure, as appropriate.
    In addition, a great amount of time, the value of which is not reflected in these accounts, is donated by around 25,000 volunteers throughout Great Britain. Volunteers play a vital
    role in our shop network operations, community fundraising activities, and back office operations. More details of the crucial role volunteers contribute to Oxfam is provided in
    the Trustees’ Report. 				
    The table below shows the number of higher-paid staff with emoluments falling in the following ranges. Emoluments include salary and taxable benefits in kind and other
    payments to employees. These include a number of allowances to cover the additional costs of working in another country for long term senior expatriate staff, to enable them
    to take their family with them, as this encourages staff to stay on deployment longer. For example, Oxfam pays towards the cost of education for up to three children, where
    suitable free schooling is not available. Allowances also cover the additional cost of living in very expensive countries and end of contract payments in lieu of access to a bona
    fide pension arrangement outside the UK. 							
    Overseas numbers continue to be impacted by the weak GB Pound against other currencies, and particularly the US dollar. The figures for the seven overseas based employees
    earning over £100,000 include employees with pay set in USD and include payments for accommodation, education and end of contract payments in lieu of access to a bona fide

   The end of contract provision is a two-fold arrangement for staff on non-UK contracts. The first element is a gratuity, where a lump sum is paid at the end of their contract in
   lieu of Oxfam paying monthly amounts into a pension scheme. The second element is a loyalty bonus, which is paid specifically to staff on fixed-term contracts as an incentive
   to complete the full period of service. Payment is due once an employee’s contract comes to an end.
   The provision for dilapidations is to cover the probable future costs of restoring properties to their required condition at the end of their lease. Payment is potentially due at the
   end of the lease, based on dilapidation costs required, provided the lease is not renewed.							
17 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
   The following contingent liabilities existed at 31 March 2020:			
   Members of Oxfam’s defined benefit scheme are entitled to join TPT Retirement Solutions Growth Plan into which they can pay additional voluntary contributions to fund
   additional benefits. Oxfam does not make employer contributions into the Plan, but under government regulations which came into force in September 2005 there is a potential
   employer liability on withdrawal from the Plan or in the event of the Plan winding up when it is not fully funded on a buy-out basis. The amount of employer liability on withdrawal
   for Oxfam as at 30 September 2019 has been calculated as £0.9m (2018/19: £0.9m). However, at present Oxfam has no intention of withdrawing from the Plan and the Trustees of
   the Plan have no intention of winding it up; it is therefore unlikely that the liability will crystallise in the foreseeable future.

    Fund balances may be negative when expenditure is made on a project that is expected to be reimbursed by a government or other agency, but where, at the end of the
    financial year, not all the conditions have been met that would justify this income being recognised within the accounts. This results in an excess of expenditure over income
    on some project funds. The total deficit fund balances at 31 March 2020 amounted to £16.9m (31 March 2019: £19.4m). The Trustees consider that the likelihood of
    reimbursement is of sufficient level to justify the carrying of these deficit funds at the end of the year.

Oxfam Accounts for the year to 31 March 2020
d.  Pension scheme commitments
    Oxfam operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees.
i)  Defined benefit pension scheme
    The assets of the pension scheme are held separately from those of Oxfam and are administered by TPT Retirement Solutions. The pension cost is determined on the advice of
    independent qualified actuaries, with the last triennial valuation being carried out as at 30 September 2019. An actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2020 by a
    qualified independent actuary, based on the provisions of FRS102.							
    Oxfam, Oxfam Ireland, and Oxfam International participate in a joint scheme, whereby the assets and liabilities of the scheme are not readily identifiable by each individual
    employer. As a result and given that Oxfam employees represent over 98% of the scheme participants, the full pension liability, SOFA charge and disclosures of the scheme are
    reflected in the Oxfam accounts.							
    The scheme was closed to new members on 31 January 2003 and as a result, the current service cost increases as the members of the scheme approach retirement. The
    scheme is funded and the employer’s contribution is 10.6% of pensionable pay (2018/19: 10.6%). The employees’ contribution is 6.0%, 8.7% or 9.2% of pensionable pay
    depending on the individual’s level of total pensionable pay (2018/19: 6.0%, 8.7% or 9.2%). The current service cost for this scheme for the year was £1.0m (2018/19: £1.0m).
    Contributions paid by Oxfam GB during the year were £6.5m (2018/19: £6.5m). In addition, Oxfam Ireland and Oxfam International paid £0.1m (2018/19: £0.1m) of contributions into
    the scheme for their employees.							
    The best estimate of contributions expected to be paid to the scheme by Oxfam for the year to 31 March 2021 is £1.1m.
    As required by FRS102, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method. The tables below state the FRS102 actuarial assumptions upon which
    the valuation of the scheme was based.

     The actual return on scheme assets for the year was £25.2m (2018/19: £14.1m).
ii)  Growth Plan
     As noted in Note 17, Oxfam participates in TPT Retirement Solutions’ Growth Plan, a multi-employer pension plan. Based on the latest triennial valuation of the scheme carried
     out on 30 September 2017, the scheme assets amounted to £794.9m, whilst liabilities were £926.4m, resulting in a deficit of £131.5m. A deficit recovery plan to 31 January 2025
     has been put in place which will require Oxfam to make annual payments of £86,939 from April 2020, increasing by 3% per annum. The full liability to Oxfam has been reflected
     through the SOFA and pension reserve, with the annual contribution reflected as a transfer between the pension reserve and general reserve.
     In the event of other scheme members defaulting on their deficit commitments, the liabilities arising would be spread across the remaining members of the scheme.
iii) Defined contribution pension scheme
     For employees not in the defined benefit scheme Oxfam operates a Stakeholder Pension Scheme. This is a defined contribution scheme from Aviva. From 1 January 2003 Oxfam
     contributed double the employee contributions up to a maximum of 10% of pensionable pay. Oxfam contributed £3.6m (2018/19: £3.4m) to this pension scheme in the year to 31
     March 2020. Contributions are reflected in expenditure on the same basis as an individual’s salary allocation.
iv)  Alternative pension arrangements
     When staff are not eligible to join the Stakeholder Pension Scheme or the Oxfam Pension Scheme, Oxfam offers alternative arrangements as appropriate.

Thank you
We would like to take this opportunity to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has worked with
Oxfam GB to help overcome the injustice of poverty this year. We are so much stronger together against
the injustices people face, and together we have delivered so much. We can acknowledge just some of
you here, but please know that – however you took action against poverty with Oxfam in 2019/20 – our
work would not have been possible without you. Thank you.
