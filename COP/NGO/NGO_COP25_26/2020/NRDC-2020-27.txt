       COLORADO’S CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY | 7
                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




The Colorado Legislature passed a law (HB 19-1261) in 2019 to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution 26 percent by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030
compared to 2005 levels of emissions. The state is not currently on track to
meet these goals for 2025 and 2030. This report details pathways for the
state to reduce its GHG emissions while ensuring that the benefits of a cleaner
Colorado are shared amongst all communities.

Through this analysis, we envision a better future for all, one in which every
community benefits from clean air and water, every household avoids
enormous suffering from worsening wildfires, droughts, and floods, every family
can affordably heat their home in the winter, and every Coloradan across the
state goes to work to build a clean, efficient, and just energy system.

Decades of inequitable resource placement and access have burdened
communities of color and low-income communities with disproportionate
exposure to pollution. Our analysis shows that meeting the climate goals results
in significant reductions in pollution harmful to human health. However, as
we decarbonize, disparities may remain in the distribution of pollution across
communities and access to clean energy solutions. A transition to a cleaner
Colorado must ensure that GHG reduction policies address these systemic
injustices instead of perpetuating the current inequities in access to clean
energy and distribution of air pollution and energy burden. Early and ongoing
engagement with historically underserved and environmentally overburdened
communities throughout the decarbonization process will help identify
strategies to ensure clean energy benefits accrue to all Coloradans.

This Executive Summary contains two parts. Part I, the “Summary Modeling
Results,” explains the key energy system modeling findings conducted by
Evolved Energy Research and discusses the level of emission reductions,
infrastructure upgrades, and operation changes needed from each sector of
the economy. Part I also discusses the analysis that Physicians, Scientists, and
Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE) conducted on the equity implications of
GHG reduction pathways. Part II, the “Outline of Policy Recommendations,”
summarizes the specific policies that, taken together, can provide the emissions
reductions we need in each sector. The details of each policy recommendation
are included later in the report.



PART I: SUMMARY MODELING RESULTS

ELECTRIC SECTOR

DECARBONIZE THE ELECTRIC SECTOR AT LEAST 90 PERCENT AND
OPTIMALLY 98 TO 99 PERCENT BY 2030

In our Core decarbonization scenario, the electricity sector almost completely
decarbonizes by 2030, and all coal units retire by 2025. Some gas units remain,
but they operate very infrequently (generating only 2 percent of electricity
in 2030), mostly during sustained periods of low renewable output. The
decarbonized electricity system relies on large amounts of wind and solar,
new energy storage, strategic use of flexible loads, and coordination with
other states in the region. This rapid transition to clean electricity is not only
necessary to reduce pollution from the power sector itself but also to enable
reductions in emissions from transportation, buildings, and industry through
electrification.

In addition to deeply decarbonizing, the state should prioritize decarbonizing
the electric sector as quickly as possible, within reliability and cost constraints.
With existing policies, Colorado is not building renewables and storage fast
enough and will not achieve the required electric sector emission reductions
to meet its climate goals.

Our modeling shows that it would be cheaper and more feasible to achieve
the state’s climate goals with much higher reductions from the electric
sector—98 to 99 percent by 2030. If Colorado does not decarbonize the
electric sector by 98 to 99 percent by 2030, then other sectors will have to
make up the difference by electrifying transportation, upgrading buildings,
and transitioning away from fossil fuel use even more quickly—including
solutions with other downsides, such as additional expense and pollution
from biofuel combustion. The scenario in which the power sector delays
deep decarbonization is more expensive than any other scenario we analyzed,
including a scenario that entirely eliminates fossil fuels from the economy
by 2050.




                        COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 9
PRIORITIZE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH
POLLUTION BURDENS

Our analysis shows the overwhelming majority of fossil fuel power plants in
Colorado are located in communities with higher-than-median poverty rates,
higher percentage of population that are people of color, or both. Rapidly
retiring and cutting utilization of these power plants, as is required to meet the
climate goals, will result in significant reductions in harmful air pollution. State
policymakers and utilities should consult with local communities living near
fossil fuel power plants to determine how to prioritize retirement of, or pollution
reductions from, power plants located in communities with high pollution
burdens.


EXPAND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW-
INCOME CUSTOMERS

All pathways for meeting the climate goals involve significant increases in
energy efficiency measures to reduce energy demand and reduce pressure on
the electricity system. In addition, our analysis shows that people with lower
incomes spend a higher share of their income on electricity than higher-income
households. One way to address the high energy burden that low-income
customers face is to expand energy efficiency programs to reach more low-
income customers. Doing so is a win-win strategy, because energy efficiency
programs both lower customers’ energy bills and reduce emissions.




                    COLORADO’S CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY | 10
TRANSPORTATION

ACCELERATE ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES

In the scenarios in which Colorado meets its climate targets, electric vehicles
make up at least 27 percent of new car sales and 8 percent of new light truck
sales by 2025 and 66 percent of new car sales and 40 percent of new light
truck sales by 2030. By 2035 or soon thereafter, nearly all car and light truck
sales should be electric. However, as of 2018, fewer than 2 percent of total
vehicle sales in Colorado were battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles. With existing policy, the state is not on a trajectory to decarbonize
the transportation sector at the pace required to meet the 2030 climate goal.

Colorado must rapidly electrify cars and light trucks and transition to zero-
emission vehicles for medium- and heavy-duty applications to meet its
climate goals. The fleet of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles must transition
away from gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, though on a slightly later
timeline: zero-emission vehicles will have to make up at least 21 percent of
new medium- and heavy-duty trucks by 2030 and close to 100 percent by
2040. The substantial gap between current levels and future targets, coupled
with the challenge of decarbonizing large stocks of vehicles, means that state
policymakers must move quickly. Over the long term, electrifying personal
vehicles can save Coloradans money because electric vehicles are more
efficient and have lower operating and maintenance costs than gasoline-
powered vehicles.

Reductions in transportation energy demand and vehicle electrification
makes the transportation system significantly less energy intensive and plays
an important role in meeting the climate goals. Moreover, infrastructure and
planning to shift from vehicle use to public transit, walking, and cycling will
reduce energy demand even further.


PRIORITIZE REDUCTIONS IN PARTICULATE MATTER POLLUTION FROM
TRANSPORTATION IN COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH AIR POLLUTION

Meeting the climate goals will result in significant reduction in harmful air
pollution. However, our analysis indicates that medium- and heavy-duty trucks,
which primarily run on diesel today, will likely decarbonize at a slower rate than
passenger vehicles, resulting in a slower rate of decline for particulate matter
(PM) emissions, including both PM10 and PM2.5, than for other air pollutants,
such as NOx and SO2. Moreover, in certain high-traffic areas, particularly urban
areas near interstate highways and certain rural areas with heavy diesel truck
traffic, PM emissions may actually increase between 2020 and 2030 even while
overall GHG emissions from transportation decline. Low-income people and
people of color are more likely to live in areas with more air pollution from
diesel trucks. The state needs to take steps to prevent these communities




                       COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 11
from facing continued disproportionate pollution impacts by investing in
electric charging infrastructure along urban interstate highway corridors;
rerouting diesel truck traffic away from heavily populated areas, where feasible;
electrifying heavy-duty trucks; and reducing vehicle miles traveled through
public transportation.



BUILDINGS

ACCELERATE ELECTRIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY
EFFICIENCY

Our analysis shows that emissions from the buildings sector must decrease
by at least 9 to 14 percent from 2005 levels to meet the 2030 climate goals.
Accelerated electrification in space heating, hot water heating, and cooking,
along with energy efficiency, are necessary to provide these reductions. Absent
new policy, the state will not achieve the level of building electrification and
efficiency required to meet the climate goals and risks increasing building
sector emissions.




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 12
One pathway to meeting the climate goals would require at least 55 percent
of new homes to be all electric by 2025 and all new homes to be all electric by
2030 or soon thereafter. In this scenario, 2 to 3 percent of non-electric space
heaters and 4 to 5 percent of non-electric water heaters in existing homes must
be replaced with electric heat pumps each year.

Commercial buildings must follow a similar trajectory. By 2025, 12 percent of
commercial space heater sales and 4 percent of commercial water heater sales
must be electric, including replacement of appliances in existing buildings and
new appliances for new buildings. By 2030, 36 percent of space heater sales
and 30 percent of water heater sales are electric in all scenarios meeting the
climate goals. Similar to the challenge of vehicle stock turnover, there is no time
to waste. Transformative electrification of stocks of space heaters and water
heaters will take time, and the state must accelerate adoption immediately.

The state’s building stock must also become significantly more efficient.
Adoption of highly efficient, electric appliances must accelerate, with efficient
options comprising about 80 percent of appliance sales by 2030. A growing
portion of new buildings must be built with highly efficient shells, and the
state must retrofit at least 1 to 2 percent of existing homes per year in the next
decade to reach energy savings necessary to reach the state’s targets.


PRIORITIZE BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION AND EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS
FOR AREAS WITH HIGH ENERGY BURDENS

Our analysis shows that Colorado residents in rural areas spend a higher portion
of their income on heating, cooling, and cooking than residents of other parts
of the state, on average. Many low-income households in urban areas also have
high residential energy burdens. Increased energy efficiency and electrification
can reduce residential energy burdens, so the state should prioritize building
electrification programs in these rural and urbans areas with the highest energy
burdens.

In addition to reducing GHG emissions and lowering energy burdens, energy
efficiency measures and building electrification can also reduce harmful air
pollutants generated at home. The primary air pollutants generated at home
are NOx from burning gas and PM2.5 from burning wood. Energy efficiency and
electrification can reduce these dangerous emissions and thereby improve both
indoor and outdoor air quality.

OIL AND GAS

REDUCE METHANE AND CO2 EMISSIONS FROM OIL & GAS PRODUCTION

Meeting the climate goals requires significant cuts in methane emissions from
oil and gas production, processing, and transportation. Colorado must reduce
methane emissions from the oil and gas production sector by at least 54
percent by 2030 relative to 2005 levels to meet the state’s climate goals.

Methane emissions can be reduced by decreasing the rate of methane
leakage, decreasing production, or a combination of the two approaches. In
our modeling, the oil and gas sector achieves the required methane emission
reductions by reducing the methane leakage rate by 57 percent from the
current leakage rate and by reducing overall output 25 percent relative to 2019
production levels.

This report also recommends modest near-term reductions in oil and gas
production for two reasons. First, oil and gas production in Colorado has
increased dramatically since 2005. Increases to oil and gas production will
necessitate even greater reductions in the methane leakage rate and make it
even more difficult to achieve the overall level of methane reductions needed
from the oil and gas sector. Second, our modeling indicates that Colorado
can achieve its climate goals only if it significantly reduces use of oil and gas
(e.g., the use of gasoline and diesel in transportation, the burning of gas for
electricity and heat, etc.). Given that GHGs are global pollutants, Colorado
wants other states and countries to adopt similar policies to make similar
reductions in GHG emissions. It is inconsistent for the state to chart pathways
to address climate-warming pollution while simultaneously proposing to
expand oil and gas production for export to other states and countries
(as shown in the state’s Roadmap). Our recommendation that oil and gas
production decline 25 percent by 2030 relative to 2019 levels is in line with the
overall decline in oil and gas use of 30 percent by 2030 that Colorado needs to
achieve to meet its climate goals.

In addition, our analysis shows that industrial point sources—including oil and
gas wells and other infrastructure—are more highly concentrated in locations
with higher numbers of people of color. Expansion of oil and gas production
will exacerbate pollution exposure for these communities. Adopting larger
setback requirements can help protect communities from the health impacts
of oil and gas development. In addition, state policymakers should consider the
cumulative pollution impacts from oil and gas development and other pollution
sources on communities in the permitting process and prioritize health
protections for communities that have high overall levels of air pollution.

COMPARISON WITH THE STATE’S ROADMAP

Multiple state agencies, coordinated by the Colorado Energy Office, were
tasked with developing a “Roadmap” of possible actions to reduce greenhouse
gas pollution in line with HB-1261. The state’s modeling in the “Roadmap” study
differs in a few important ways from Evolved and PSE’s modeling, as explained
in more depth in the body of the report, but below is a high-level comparison
between the two trajectories for emissions reductions and the measures to
achieve those emission reductions.

FIGURE ES-1. G
             “CORE SCENARIO”

The Roadmap and Evolved’s analysis show similar trajectories for total net GHG emissions,
as these trajectories are defined by the HB-1261 targets. The net-negative transportation
emissions in 2050 are the result of a small amount of biofuels with carbon capture and
sequestration. Negative emissions represent captured and sequestered CO2 . The “Other”
category includes agricultural emissions, other methane emissions, and hydrofluorocarbons
(powerful greenhouse gases primarily used for cooling and refrigeration).

2	 HB 19-1261 sets statewide GHG emission goals. Carbon dioxide emissions account for the overwhelming majority of the GHGs that
are directly emitted by electric generators. Thus, this section focuses on CO2 emission reductions. There are upstream emissions of
other GHGs associated with electricity production, primarily methane emissions from oil & gas production and coal mining. Methane
emissions are addressed in a separate section on fossil fuel production.

                              INTRODUCTION




The climate crisis is harming families, communities, and businesses across
Colorado. This report outlines pathways for the state to take effective climate
action and achieve the statewide reductions in GHG emissions required by
Colorado’s landmark 2019 law, HB-1261, and analyzes the health and equity
implications of different decarbonization pathways. The report also includes
policy recommendations to turn the modeling into reality.

Our analysis sought to answer the following questions: What technological,
infrastructure, and operational changes must the energy and industrial system
make to achieve the state’s climate goals? What are the tradeoffs from key
decisions, such as the extent of demand reduction measures, the ambition
of power sector emissions reduction targets, and the fate of oil and gas
production? What policies are required to put the state on track to meet its
goals? And what are the equity and pollution impacts for communities in the
state?

We set out to envision a better future for Colorado, one in which every
community benefits from clean air, reduced warming avoids enormous suffering
from worsening wildfires, drought, and floods, no Coloradan has to worry
about whether they will be able to afford to keep the lights on in their home,
policymakers care for and protect the workers who have run our energy system
for so long, and people across the state go to work in clean energy jobs to build
a clean, efficient, and just energy system.

Recognizing that the Colorado Energy Office is developing its own Roadmap
and has hired E3 to provide analysis for achieving the GHG reductions required
by HB-1261, this report aims to provide additional technical insights, present
alternative pathways to those in the state’s analysis, and emphasize the equity
and health implications of decarbonization pathways.

Macroeconomic and jobs analysis is not within the scope of this report. Several
recent analyses (e.g., Rewiring America, 2035 Report) demonstrate significant
employment benefits of swift, deep decarbonization, as the process of
upgrading our transportation, buildings, industrial, and electricity infrastructure
will require millions more clean energy workers across the country.

                                         SETTING THE STAGE




According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the consensus
among climate scientists is that the world must cut carbon dioxide emissions
in half by 2030 and to net zero by 2050 at the latest in order to have a chance
of limiting the most catastrophic effects of climate change. What we do to
transform our economy over the next decade—from local and state government
policy to international cooperation—is instrumental to the future of our state,
country, and world.

The impacts of the climate crisis are already here in Colorado. Coloradans have
seen an increase in deadly, polluting, and expensive wildfires, extended drought
conditions, and more frequent 100-year flooding events due to a warming
climate. In 2018 alone, the wildfire season cost state and local governments
over 145 million dollars. It is critical that we do our part to address climate
change to protect our natural spaces, farmlands, and communities at risk of
climate disasters.

Thankfully, Colorado is positioning itself as a leader in climate action and
renewable energy. Governor Jared Polis was elected on a platform of getting
the state to 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. In 2019, Governor Polis
signed into law HB-1261, which requires the state to reduce economy-wide
GHG emissions 26 percent by 2025, 50 percent by 2030, and 90 percent by
2050 relative to 2005 emission levels. Meeting these goals will require swift
and transformative action across all sectors of the economy. To make a plan for
Colorado to meet its future climate goals, we must first understand where we
are starting.


         Colorado is projected to emit approximately 128 million metric tons of
    CO2 equivalents in 2020, with electricity, transportation, and fossil fuel extraction
                           making up the bulk of emissions.



Colorado’s annual GHG emissions totaled about 139 million metric tons of CO2
equivalents (MMT CO2e) in 2005, according to the state’s Roadmap Analysis.3
Since then, the state’s annual emissions have declined slightly, reaching 132
MMT in 2015 and approximately 128 MMT this year, according to the state’s
projections. The reductions to date are the result of substantial clean energy
growth in the electricity sector and a slight decline in transportation emissions.
To achieve the goals in HB-1261, Colorado must cut about 25 MMT CO2e by
2025, 58 MMT by 2030, and 113 MMT by 2050. The required 2030 reductions
are equivalent to slightly more than the total current emissions from the
electricity and transportation sectors combined—no small feat. Electricity
generation, transportation, and the production and processing of oil and

3	 The 2005 baseline is based on the state’s estimates in the document entitled “CO GHG Roadmap Assumptions &
Results_2020-06-18.” We reognize that the state may update the methodology used for these estimates, resulting in changes to the
baseline emissions value, but we anticipate that these changes will have a small impact.

 gas are the state’s largest sources of climate-warming pollution, together
 comprising 63 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions. Industrial energy
 use is the next largest source at 11 percent, followed by buildings at 10 percent,
 as Figure 1 below indicates.

 GHG emissions have been declining in Colorado since 2005, but much more rapid
 decarbonization will be needed to reach the state’s 2025, 2030, and 2050 goals. Data source:

        Colorado’s energy and industrial systems emit harmful pollution across the state, and
         low-income communities and communities of color bear the brunt of the impacts.



 Colorado’s existing energy, industrial, and fossil fuel infrastructure emits
 health-damaging pollution in communities across the state. These emissions
 include criteria air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur
 dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), as well as hazardous air pollutants
 such as benzene and mercury. These pollutants contribute to a wide range of
 health impacts, including cardiovascular and respiratory problems, adverse
 birth outcomes, asthma, cancer, and premature death. Children, the elderly,
 and those with underlying health conditions are particularly vulnerable to
 these health impacts. Some of these pollutants are unique to certain fuels or
 processes; for example, mercury and sulfur dioxide emissions are associated
 primarily with coal combustion. Other pollutants such as fine particulate matter
 and nitrogen oxides (a precursor for ozone and secondary fine particulate
 matter formation) are produced from fossil fuel and biomass combustion.
 Pollution health impacts are often highest for those living near or downwind
 from the source of pollution, but pollutants also have broad regional impacts
 many miles from the emission source. Figure 2 below shows how the emissions




                                    COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 23
of fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide compare with
carbon dioxide emissions across sectors in 2017.

Air pollution varies by sector and fuel, and the pollution reductions and
associated health impacts from decarbonization will depend on the distribution
of reductions between sectors and the fuels that phase out first.

FIGURE 2.              	   CO2 AND PRIMARY CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS BY SECTOR IN 2017

Reducing CO2 emissions in different sectors and from different fuels will have different
impacts on co-pollutant emission reductions, both on the type of pollutants and where they
are emitted. Data sources: U.S. EPA; U.S. EIA; U.S. Census Bureau; Evolved modeling.

Some pollutants, such as SO2 which largely comes from coal plants, are
primarily emitted in rural parts of Colorado. Other pollutants, such as NOx, are
higher in urban areas. However, as shown in Figure 3, NOx pollution occurs
statewide, and the secondary formation of ozone and particulate matter from
instate NOx pollution affects even broader regions throughout the state and
beyond. Figure 3 shows a map of NOx point sources and annual NOx emissions
across all sectors, indicating which counties contain sources of NOx emissions
and which have the highest total NOx emissions. Figure 4 shows major point
sources overlaid on a Demographic Index (described in the Methodology
section) that characterizes census tracts by the socioeconomic vulnerability of
their populations.




                                            COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 24
Roadways, industrial point sources, and power plants overlap with places that
have higher NOx emissions, illustrated by the darker red counties in Figure 3,
and many of these sources are located in communities with high cumulative
socioeconomic vulnerability, as shown in Figure 4. Emissions are notably high
in the Denver area, where point sources are concentrated and which is out of
attainment for federal ozone standards.

Regional criteria pollutant emission reductions—and legacy pollution in 2050—
will vary under different decarbonization pathways depending on the rate at
which different sectors and regions adopt cleaner energy technologies.

FIGURE 3. ANNUAL NOX EMISSIONS IN 2017 AND MAP OF NOX POINT SOURCES

Darker red areas indicate counties with high NOx emissions. Denver and the surrounding
counties have high NOx emissions, as do some rural counties in the northwest part of the
state. Oil and gas wells, industrial point sources, and power plants are predominantly
located in counties with high NOx emissions. Because of data limitations, some
decentralized sources of pollution, such as oil and gas wells, are not included in the
estimates of total NOx emissions—meaning NOx pollution may be even more geographically
distributed throughout Colorado than pictured here. Data sources: EIA NEI 2017

                 Major point sources of pollution, except for coal plants, are concentrated in the highly
                 populated Denver area, including in areas where populations have high cumulative
                 socioeconomic vulnerability as reflected in the Demographic Index. This Index, described
                 in the

                 rural communities are also located in places with high socioeconomic vulnerability, though
                 some major sources are not.

                                             Distributed clean energy adoption and the resulting energy cost
                                                        savings have not been distributed equitably.



                       While clean energy has grown in Colorado, distributed energy resources
                       such as rooftop solar have not been adopted equally across all income levels
                       and communities. As of June 2020, Colorado has a considerable amount of
                       distributed solar photovoltaic capacity, approximately 410 MW. The highest-
                       earning Coloradans (top 20 percent of households by income) have adopted
                       rooftop solar systems at 16 times the rate of the lowest-earning households
                       (bottom 20 percent).




                                                                        COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 26
Adoption of electric vehicles has followed a similar pattern in Colorado, with
households in the top 20 percent of zip codes by income adopting electric
vehicles at eight times the rate of households in lowest-income zip codes
(bottom 20 percent). Energy efficiency faces similar barriers of high upfront
costs. Adoption of all of these distributed energy resources is more challenging
for people who rent their homes, especially in the absence of programs and
financing models that target low-income customers.

The lowest-income households therefore have little access to the direct long-
term savings provided by these distributed energy technologies and associated
policies, like net metering subsidies. These trends suggest that we should
not expect further growth to be equitable without policies that explicitly try
to expand access to clean energy technologies to Coloradans who cannot
currently afford them.

Moreover, low-income households and those in disadvantaged communities
could benefit substantially from cost-saving clean technologies. Figure 5
below plots the combined energy burden from housing and transportation
by census tract where the x-axis shows an increase in income from left to
right and the y-axis shows an increase in burden from bottom to top. Low-
income households pay a disproportionate share of their income on energy
and transportation costs. Low-income households stand to benefit from
clean energy measures that reduce overall system costs as well as energy
burdens. These measures can come in the form of facilitating greater access
to consumer-adopted clean energy measures and ensuring that utilities adopt
cost-effective and clean resource portfolios.

      Energy burden rises exponentially as income declines, on average. Residents of rural areas
      tend to have a higher energy burden than residents in urban and micro (suburban) areas.

      While many clean energy technologies are economically inaccessible to
      low-income Coloradans, in part due to high up-front costs, their lifetime
      economic savings could help reduce bills for some of Colorado’s lowest-income
      households. Vulnerable populations may also benefit from the resilience
      provided by energy storage and more consistent heating and cooling in the
      face of cold winters or climate-driven heat waves as provided by efficiency and
      electrification upgrades.

      Energy burdens are highest for low-income households even though these
      households do not have the highest carbon footprints—higher-income
      households tend to have more cars, drive more, and use more energy to
      support larger houses. Policies focused primarily on high-carbon-footprint
      households will therefore miss those who might realize the greatest economic
      benefits from clean energy. As policymakers work to accelerate clean energy
      growth, they should consider the existing inequities in clean energy adoption
      and craft policies to ensure equitable access to the benefits of a clean transition
      going forward.


                                                         Colorado faces interlocking economic and environmental crises,
                                                              and addressing them requires interlocking solutions.



      While developing its plan to address the climate crisis, Colorado is facing the
      staggering public health and economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic,




                                                                           COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 28
which are compounding the effects of underinvestment, systemic racism, and
structural inequality. These conditions existed before the pandemic and will be
further exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The ongoing crisis has left
more than 300,000 Coloradans unemployed (over 10 percent of the workforce).
As the crisis continues, hundreds of thousands of Coloradans are losing income
and accumulating debt. By one estimate, 420,000 Coloradans are at risk of
being evicted and facing the harsh long-term consequences—homelessness,
poverty, food insecurity, and lack of access to credit to recover. Evictions affect
low-income people and communities of color the most.

The social, economic, and racial context is inseparable from our understanding
of pathways to address climate change and policies to effectively realize these
pathways. As we show in this report, meeting the state’s climate goals requires
a transformation of every sector of the economy, including upgrading the
homes and vehicles of millions of Coloradans. Policy solutions that upgrade our
energy infrastructure without also addressing the inequitable systems that have
caused worsening economic inequality, rising debt, and the affordable housing
shortage will lead to a clean economy that replicates or exacerbates existing
disparities.

                             METHODOLOGY




The arguments in this report are based on modeling and analysis from Evolved
Energy Research (Evolved) and Physicians, Scientists, and Engineers for
Healthy Energy (PSE). Evolved conducted energy system modeling to chart
energy system pathways consistent with the HB-1261 targets. PSE then used the
energy system modeling results, combined with other historical data, to analyze
the health and equity implications of decarbonization pathways. This section
describes the key components of the methodology. The forthcoming technical
appendix includes more details on methodology and assumptions.



ENERGY SYSTEM MODELING

Evolved modeled the energy system using two tools: EnergyPATHWAYS and
the Regional Investment and Operations (RIO) platform.

EnergyPATHWAYS is a bottom-up energy sector scenario planning tool. It
performs a full accounting of all energy, cost, and carbon flows in the economy
and can be used to represent both current fossil-based energy systems
as well as transformed, low-carbon energy systems. The tool represents
infrastructure that produces, converts, stores, delivers, or consumes energy
with a robust set of technology options. It includes detailed representations
of existing infrastructure (e.g., power plants, refineries, equipment stock in
buildings, vehicle stock) and options for new infrastructure and resources. We
used EnergyPATHWAYS to produce demand-side scenarios based on input
assumptions for technology stock turnover under each policy scenario we
considered. The model produces results for fuel and electricity demand based
on these assumptions.

Evolved paired EnergyPATHWAYS with RIO, an energy system planning tool
that is specifically designed to study deeply decarbonized energy systems,
which will work very differently from today’s system. RIO finds the least-cost
set of investments and operational strategies for the energy supply system,
considering future policy, fuel pricing, technology pricing, and demand-side
flexibility. The platform represents investment and operation decisions in the
electricity sector and fuel production for direct use. RIO also captures the
time variability of electricity supply and demand with high resolution, which is
important for characterizing systems with significant variable renewable energy
generation. We used RIO to optimize energy supply decisions based on the
demand-side results generated from EnergyPATHWAYS and considering an
emissions constraint for each state.

Both models rely on input assumptions for fuel price forecasts, technology




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 30
costs, and technology performance characteristics. We chose these
assumptions based on reputable and commonly used sources, detailed in the
technical appendix.

Our assumptions on biofuels availability are of particular importance to the
modeling results. Biomass feedstocks carry climate and ecological risks,
and only a subset of feedstocks are appropriate to use as environmentally
sustainable and climate-friendly solutions. For this reason, Evolved’s analysis
restricts biomass availability to a subset of feedstocks with lower risks. This
mix excludes high-risk feedstocks, such as forest biomass. In total, 430 million
dry tons per year of sustainable biomass feedstocks are available in the model.
Given this limited supply, and the attractiveness of carbon capture on biofuels
facilities, some biofuels from this biomass are considered negative emissions.
Biofuels can be imported or made in-state using the Fischer-Tropsch process
(for diesel and jet fuel replacements), pyrolysis (for heavy fuel oil and solid
fuel replacements), and bio-hydrogen and cellulosic ethanol (for gasoline
replacement) conversion technologies. As noted elsewhere in the report,
policymakers must ensure that all biofuels used to cut emissions are produced
using sustainable biomass that is independently certified to the Roundtable on
Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) or equivalent standard.

SCENARIO DESCRIPTIONS

Evolved modeled several scenarios for comparison. At the heart of the analysis
is a comparison between business-as-usual and a future in which the state acts
appropriately to meet the HB-1261 targets. This central comparison is between
two scenarios:


           REFERENCE

           Scenario that represents business as usual for comparison with the
           decarbonization scenarios. No emissions reductions are required, and Colorado
           does not meet its HB-1261 goals.

           CORE

           Decarbonization case on which the other scenarios are built. Includes a mix
           of achievable but aggressive demand-side transformation paired with rapid
           electricity decarbonization to achieve 2030 goals, and the model selects the
           most cost-effective energy supply (fuel production and electricity) portfolio for
           achieving the emission reduction goals in HB-1261. The 2050 goals are achieved
           with almost complete electrification of on-road transportation, heating, and the
           limited deployment of low-carbon fuels.
           The Core scenario represents the central decarbonization scenario on which
           Evolved built three other scenarios in which the state achieves the HB-1261
           targets. These three scenarios maintain most aspects of the Core scenario while
           changing a small number of key assumptions to understand the importance of
           relevant decisions.

           SLOW ELECTRICITY

           Decarbonization scenario to assess the costs of delay in power sector emissions
           reductions. Includes delayed closure of coal plants that do not have confirmed
           retirement dates. Requires accelerated electrification past what some might
           consider achievable in the 2030 timeframe to make up for smaller emission
           reductions in the power sector. By 2050, scenario outcomes converge with the
           Core scenari

           LOW DEMAND

           Decarbonization scenario to assess the benefits of measures to reduce demand,
           beyond the energy efficiency included in the Core scenario. Includes reduced
           demand for energy services due to increased energy efficiency measures,
           retrofits of existing homes, and buildout of public transit infrastructure,
           alongside reduced heavy-duty vehicle and aviation use.

           FOSSIL FREE

           Decarbonization scenario that focuses on a full transition to zero fossil
           fuel production and use across the country by 2050. Emphasis is on the
           infrastructure necessary to support such a future and implications for siting,
           economic development, and the pace of expansion of clean electricity.
           Constraints through 2030 are identical to the Core scenario. This scenario has a
           more limiting 2050 constraint (no fossil fuel use) than the HB-1261 targets and
           requires greater ambition from the energy and industrial system. Therefore, it
           is not an “apples-to-apples” comparison with the other scenarios but rather a
           scenario that provides insight into pathways to even deeper decarbonization of
           the economy.

modeling for each scenario are below in Table 1 and 2, with more details

                     from 2015 levels by 2030. Modest electrification of industrial processes.



NON ENERGY EMISSIONS

Evolved’s modeling focused on energy and industrial emissions, but HB-
1261 covers economy-wide emissions, which extend beyond the energy and
industrial systems and include non-energy agricultural emissions, other
methane sources, and hydrofluorocarbons. The required reductions in
energy and industrial CO2 emissions (and oil and gas methane emissions) are
dependent on assumptions for future changes in these non-energy emissions.
Our analysis assumes that the reductions in other non-energy emissions are
very similar to the reductions specified in the state’s Roadmap. In our analysis,
these emissions decline to 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and 52
percent below 2050 levels. Reductions in these emissions are not certain, and
the technical pathways and policies required to achieve these reductions are
out of the scope of this report, though these issues are important for the state
to achieve the HB-1261 goals.



HEALTH AND EQUITY ANALYSIS

PSE analyzed the health, equity, and distributional implications of the scenarios.
This report summarizes some of the key findings of PSE’s analysis. The full
results of PSE’s health and equity analysis will be published separately.




                           COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 35
PSE’s analysis covered:
    •	 The relationship between socioeconomic and demographic indicators
       across the state and energy system impacts and trends;
    •	 The historical distribution of health-damaging fossil fuel air pollutant
       emissions;
    •	 Modeled changes in these air pollutant emissions under the five scenarios
       and the geographic distribution of those changes;
    •	 HIstorical trends in energy costs, energy burdens, and access to clean
       energy technologies;
    •	 Modeled adoption of clean energy technologies, changes to energy costs,
       and the energy burden and equity implications of these changes.

PSE analyzed the characteristics of populations across Colorado using a mix
of data aggregated from the U.S. Census and from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency’s environmental justice screening tool EJSCREEN.
EJSCREEN includes census block group information on a set of demographic
and environmental indicators, including:4
    1.	 Minority: Non-white population fraction;
    2.	 Low-income: Population in households below double the federal poverty
        level;
    3.	 Linguistic isolation: Population living in households where no one over
        14 speaks English as a primary language and all adults speak English less
        than “very well;”
    4.	 Educational attainment: Fraction of adults with less than high school
        education;
    5.	 Children: Population fraction under age five;
    6.	 Elderly: Population fraction over 64.

To identify populations uniquely vulnerable to pollution due to cumulative
socioeconomic burdens or who might particularly benefit from the economic
savings and resilience benefits of cleaner energy technology, PSE created
a set of indices to reflect a combination of demographic indicators. This
Demographic Index was calculated by first averaging the percentiles for each
of the six listed demographic indicators. This raw value was then assigned
a statewide percentile by comparing census tracts across the state. This
percentile value is the Demographic Index.

Air pollutant emission and energy consumption data were aggregated
from numerous sources, primarily including federal datasets from the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA), U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), U.S.

4	 Descriptions and data years for EJSCREEN indicators are provided in the “Technical Documentation for EJSCREEN,” available at:

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the U.S. Census. Census tract
energy use for the residential sector was estimated using a regression model
based on EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey data and U.S. Census
American Community Survey household data. Residential emissions were
calculated by applying EPA AP-42 and California Air Resources Board (CARB)
emission factors. Transportation emissions were calculated by applying EPA
MOVES emission factors to vehicle travel and vehicle class data from the FHWA
and the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment. Household
transportation energy burdens were calculated using BTS and FHWA data. Full
data sources and methods will be detailed in the forthcoming report from PSE.



COMPARISON WITH ROADMAP METHODOLOGY

The Colorado Energy Office and other state agencies are developing a
Roadmap of possible actions to reduce greenhouse gas pollution in line with
HB-1261 and hired E3 to conduct modeling for the Roadmap.

The methodology and assumptions that Evolved and E3 used are similar, but
differ in a few important ways:
  •	 Both Evolved’s and E3’s analyses use a pathways model
     (EnergyPATHWAYS and PATHWAYS) to develop economy-wide energy
     demand scenarios. The pathways models provide energy demand
     projections based on assumptions about stock turnover and technology
     adoption in the end-use sectors (e.g., adoption rates of electric vehicles).
     Evolved’s model then determines levels of sector emissions reductions
     through RIO’s optimization. RIO develops cost-optimal investments for
     energy supply, combining elements of electricity sector capacity expansion
     and production cost modeling to represent the power sector and analyzing
     biomass, synthetic electric fuel production, and direct air capture
     deployment in the other sectors. In place of RIO, E3’s modeling pairs its
     pathways model with the additional modeling platform, RESOLVE, which is
     an electricity sector capacity expansion modeling tool. RESOLVE is limited
     to the power sector and does not cover fuel supply in the other sectors. As
     a result, the state’s analysis includes baked-in assumptions for biofuel and
     synthetic fuel adoption and assigns greater emissions reductions to the
     end-use sectors with these assumptions than occurs in RIO with our cost,

    electricity and fuel, some of which is produced in Colorado and exported.
  •	 The Roadmap assumes that the methane leakage rate declines 75 percent

     the methane leakage rate declines 57 percent by 2030 and 71 percent by
     2050 in line with recent studies. The Roadmap also assumes a 41 percent
     increase in gas production and an 86 percent increase in oil production by
     2030 from 2019 levels, while our analysis assumes a 25 percent decrease in
     oil and gas production by 2030.

Finally, the health and equity work that PSE conducted is largely outside of the

                           MODELING RESULTS




Our analysis shows that it is feasible for Colorado to meet its climate targets
with modest increases—and potentially even savings—in energy system costs
and significant reductions in health-damaging pollution. Doing so requires
a significant buildout of renewable energy resources, rapid retirement of all
coal plants, accelerated adoption of highly efficient and electric technologies
in buildings and vehicles, and the development of infrastructure to produce
and transport clean fuels between Colorado and other western states. In
accelerating the clean energy transition, policymakers must consider equity
implications and engage communities in decision-making processes from the
beginning.


               All decarbonization scenarios require steep declines in
                        energy and industrial CO2 emissions.



All four decarbonization scenarios meet the state’s climate goals and hence
follow similar economy-wide CO2 emissions reduction trajectories, with the
greatest variation in the last years of the analysis (2045 to 2050), as seen in
Figure 6 below.

The Fossil Free scenario is more ambitious than the others because elimination
of fossil fuels from the economy results in greater emissions reductions than
the 90 percent reduction specified in HB-1261. In fact, this scenario leads to net
negative energy and industrial CO2 emissions because eliminating fossil fuel
use brings CO2 emissions to essentially zero and imported biofuels with carbon
capture and sequestration are net carbon sinks.

 FIGURE 6. ENERGY AND INDUSTRIAL CO2 EMISSIONS IN ALL MODELED SCENARIOS

 The four decarbonization scenarios show significant cuts in CO2 emissions compared to
 today’s levels. In the Reference case, emissions do not change significantly from today’s
 levels.The Fossil Free scenario has the lowest emissions in 2050 because fossil fuels are
 eliminated from the economy in this case.

 The Core scenario shows a pathway for Colorado to meet its climate goals at
 modest cost, and the Low Demand scenario shows a pathway with net savings,
 as shown in Figures 7 and 8. Keeping costs low requires the electricity sector to
 decarbonize swiftly. Hesitation in the power sector leads to much more
 expensive pathways for decarbonization, as shown by the Slow Electricity case.


                           Colorado can achieve its climate goals at modest cost
                     —and potentially even with savings—compared to business as usual.



 In the Core scenario, the total annual system cost is 2 percent higher than the
 Reference case in 2025, 10 percent higher in 2030, and only 1 percent higher
 in 2050. The cost above the Reference case peaks in the 2030s when the level
 of investment in energy demand infrastructure is greatest and then declines in
 the 2040s as some of the more efficient demand infrastructure starts to pay
 for itself. At its peak, the incremental annual cost of the Core scenario is only
 0.4 percent of the state’s 2019 gross domestic product.5 The Core scenario
 results show that $6 billion of public and private investment through 2030
 could transform the energy system to meet the 2030 goal and set the state on
 a pathway for deep decarbonization. These costs calculations do not consider
 the benefits of decarbonization, including the avoided damages of disasters
 fueled by climate change and reduced health impacts from pollution cuts.



 5	 Colorado’s GDP was $353B in 2019, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even with a severe decline in economic
 activity due to COVID, the modeled incremental costs will still be far less than 1 percent of current state GDP.

The Slow Electricity scenario is the most expensive pathway, demonstrating the
high costs of a slow pace of decarbonizing the power sector. This scenario has
the highest costs in the next decade, as it does not take advantage of cost-
effective emissions reduction opportunities in the power sector and instead
must invest in more demand-side measures and low-carbon fuels. As we show
later on, the most cost-effective pathway to meet the climate goals requires
swift decarbonization—98 to 99 percent reductions by 2030—of the power
sector.

The Low Demand scenario, which has the highest levels of energy efficiency
and demand reductions, has the lowest overall costs of the four modeled
scenarios. Costs in this scenario peak at 5 percent above the Reference case in
2030 and decline to 8 percent below the Reference case by 2050 as a result
of investments that reduce energy use. This cost trajectory shows the cost
effectiveness of energy efficiency and other demand reduction measures.

The cost of the Fossil Free scenario rises significantly in 2050 because of
the need for large quantities of synthetic substitutes for petroleum based
products. Importantly, the Fossil Free scenario is inherently more ambitious
than the other decarbonization scenarios, as it requires greater GHG emissions
reductions and replacement of fossil-based products outside of the energy
system. Even so, the cumulative cost over the next 30 years of entirely
eliminating fossil fuels from the economy is less than that of the Slow
Electricity case, illustrating the enormous expense the state faces if the power
sector does not move swiftly.

   Costs for a given year include total capital investments that year, combined with the
   operating, maintenance, and fuel costs of the energy and industrial system incurred
   that year, divided by the state population. In the Core scenario, the average annual
   system cost is about $200 per person higher than in the Reference case in 2030. The Slow
   Electricity scenario shows the greatest costs in the next decade because of the need for
   increased reductions in the transportation, buildings, and industrial sectors. The Low
   Demand scenario has the lowest costs because of reduced energy use and hence avoided
   infrastructure and fuel costs.

     The state’s Roadmap is less ambitious on power sector decarbonization and
          instead includes more aggressive reductions in the other sectors.



Different modeling approaches, assumptions, and priorities led to different
results in the Roadmap analysis and Evolved’s analysis. While the central
takeaway—the need for rapid action across all areas of the economy to meet
the 2030 target—is the same, the studies are distinct in the distribution of
emission reductions between sectors and some of the strategies for achieving
these reductions. Most notably, the Roadmap study shows significantly slower
electricity sector decarbonization by 2030 than Evolved’s analysis. Table 2
summarizes the major difference in results.

ELECTRICITY

The biggest single takeaway from our modeling effort is the urgent need for
the electricity sector to decarbonize as quickly as possible. Our model shows
this is essential for two main reasons: some of the cheapest carbon reductions
come from the electricity sector, and decarbonization of the electricity sector
is necessary for using electrification to decarbonize other sectors such as
buildings and transportation. Specifically, the state’s utilities should promptly
retire their remaining coal-fired power plants, minimize the operation of gas
plants, maximize energy efficiency (covered in detail in the Buildings section),
and rapidly build out wind, solar, and storage to nearly eliminate carbon
pollution from electricity generation within the next ten years. Colorado should
also work to further integrate its electricity system with other western states
that are likely to develop renewable resources for economic reasons (e.g.,
Wyoming, Montana) and for economic and policy reasons (e.g., New Mexico).
An integrated western grid will lead to more cost-effective emission reductions
in Colorado’s electricity sector.


      The electric sector reduces CO2 emissions to 98 to 99 percent below 2005
             levels by 2030 in the lowest-cost decarbonization scenarios.



Our modeling suggests that the most cost-effective way to reduce statewide
emissions 50 percent by 2030 is to maximize emissions reductions from the
power sector. The Core and Low Demand scenarios reduce electric-sector
carbon emissions by 98 to 99 percent by 2030 relative to 2005. Even more
pressing is that to reach the 2025 goal of a 26 percent reduction in statewide
emissions, the electric sector must reduce its carbon emissions 80 percent
by 2025. Figure 9 below shows these steep reductions in emissions. These
emission reductions translate into essentially a 72 percent renewable portfolio
standard for 2025 and 98 percent renewable portfolio standard for 2030. In
comparison, the state’s largest utilities, Xcel Energy and Tri-State Generation
and Transmission, aspire to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions 80 percent
and 70 percent by 2030, respectively. These targets, along with Xcel’s goal
of net zero emissions by 2050, are promising, but our analysis suggests the
power sector must move faster to unlock the least-cost pathway to meet
the economy-wide goals. Moreover, many coal units are slated to retire after
2025, and several coal units are slated to operate well past 2030, including the
state’s largest coal unit, Comanche 3, which is scheduled to run through 2070.
Accelerating coal unit retirements so that all coal units close no later than 2025
would be one of the most cost-effective, and largest, sources of CO2 reductions.

   Developing and operating an electricity system with such low carbon emissions
   intensity is an unprecedented but necessary endeavor. In addition to requiring
   rapid buildout of renewable energy capacity, this level of decarbonization
   requires rigorous planning, significant new policy, and coordination across
   sectors and states to ensure a reliable electricity system. Several studies
   (e.g., 2035 Report) have documented the feasibility of cutting electric sector
   emissions 90 percent by the 2030 to 2035 timeframe while maintaining
   reliability and affordable rates. Others have examined pathways to round
   out the last 10 percent, without raising electricity rates, using strategies like
   combustion of clean hydrogen in gas turbines. One of Colorado’s largest
   electric utilities, Platte River Power Authority, already has a goal of becoming
   carbon neutral by 2030.

   More utilities should follow PRPA’s and CSU’s lead in examining portfolios
   that achieve 90 to 100 percent carbon reductions by 2030. In the meantime,
   a 90 percent carbon reduction by 2030 relative to 2005 levels should be
   the minimum target for Colorado’s electric sector. If state policy aims for
   90 percent reductions in lieu of greater cuts, then policymakers must ensure
   that other sectors make up the gap through faster electrification and greater
   demand reductions.

   In setting policies for the electric sector, the Air Quality Control Commission
   (AQCC) can maintain a reliable grid by laying out a process for resolving any
   reliability concerns posed by regulations and creating a role for the Colorado
   Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to assist in reviewing any utility-specific




                                                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 46
plans presented to the AQCC for meeting GHG reduction targets. The PUC has
long regulated electric utilities under its jurisdiction with a focus on maintaining
reliability standards, and the AQCC should involve the PUC in any AQCC
rulemakings or actions that review utility plans to reduce GHG emissions.

The principal economic challenge to achieving emissions reductions from the
electric sector of greater than 80 percent is solving the seasonal balancing
problem, which occurs when renewable generation persistently over-generates
relative to demand in one season and under-generates relative to demand in
other seasons. Our modeling illustrates these balancing challenges based on
the demand profiles and projected generating resource mix. In 2030, under-
generation occurs primarily in the summer, with low wind production and high
loads (due to air conditioning), though some under-generation also occurs in
winter months as a result of increased electrification of heating (water- and
space-heating). Over-generation occurs in the shoulder months (spring and
fall) with high wind generation and low demand.

The seasonal balancing challenge is apparent in the variation in net load over
the course of the year. Net load is total electricity demand minus generation
from variable renewable energy resources (almost entirely wind and solar in
Colorado). Average net loads by hour of the day for each month are shown
below in Figure 10. Net-load deficits (shown here as positive in green) must
be met with resources other than instate wind and solar. Net-load surpluses
(shown in blue) must be curtailed, exported, shifted with energy storage or
flexible load, or used productively (in applications like steam production or
electric fuel production). In addition to showing the seasonal pattern, Figure 10
also illustrates the hourly variations in net load that also require balancing.

  Net load is total electricity demand minus generation from variable renewable energy

  excess electricity in the spring and fall.

  Several technically feasible, cost-effective solutions are available to address
  seasonal and daily imbalances between renewable generation and energy
  demand. The modeled electricity system addresses these imbalances and
  maintains reliability through an all-of-the above approach that relies on storage,
  greater grid integration (enabling imports and exports with other states), and
  some gas capacity, as shown in Figure 11.

                   •	 In the winter and summer, the state imports electricity primarily from
                      Wyoming and New Mexico. These imports all must be wind or solar to be
                      counted as zero-carbon resources for Colorado’s emissions accounting in
                      the model. However, the model does not require all of the production from
                      these plants to be imported to Colorado at all times of the year. Instead,
                      it tends to import seasonally, with wind production from these states split
                      between Colorado and other states in varying distributions throughout the
                      year. This strategy presupposes coordination and contractual structures
                      that may not exist today, but the economic benefits are obvious and
                      significant, which informs the modeled outcome. The importance of this
                      strategy illustrates the necessity to engage in more integrated planning
                      across the west, including firm contracts to ensure imports are available
                      when needed.

•	 Colorado exports excess renewable energy generation in the spring and fall
   to other states that would otherwise be running thermal power plants.
•	 Flexible loads in the form of electrolysis and electric boilers are used to
   soak up excess renewables in the spring and fall. These loads operate to
   avoid curtailment when transmission export opportunities are not available.
   The hydrogen produced from electrolysis can then be used as a fuel in
   other sectors.
•	 Gas capacity is maintained for use in periods where there is not available
   renewable generation either in state or out of state. However, the model
   runs the gas units significantly less than today to provide this seasonal
   balancing function. In the Core case, combined cycle units operate with
   a capacity factor of less than 4 percent and combustion turbines operate
   with a capacity factor of approximately 1 percent. To the extent that
   gas units are needed to run to address sub-hourly conditions on the
   grid, ensure local reliability, or provide an inertial function (all things not
   captured within the model framework), then there may be greater output
   from gas units than is optimized in the model. However, other resources,
   such as energy storage, can provide these services. Even if gas plants are
   used for these functions, the additional gas generation is likely to be small
   and we would expect utilization rates to remain low.
•	 Energy storage and flexible building and transportation loads—including
   appliances and EVs that can shift demand a few hours earlier or later—help
   balance daily supply and demand fluctuations in the seasons that have
   lower renewable energy output.

 These charts show the electricity supply portfolio and the sources of electricity demand
 by hour for a typical day in each month. All year, Colorado gets a significant quantity of
 electricity from instate renewables. In the summer months, the state relies most heavily
 on electricity imports to supplement instate renewables. The state also uses flexible load
 and storage to balance supply and demand in these months and a small amount of gas
 generation to fill in the gaps. In the spring and fall, the state exports some renewables and
 turns on electrolysis facilities to produce hydrogen with excess renewables, shown in the
 load chart.

 If the power sector does not meet the needed emission reductions quickly
 enough, as in the Slow Electricity scenario, then the other sectors must
 decarbonize even more quickly. In the Slow Electricity scenario, Colorado’s
 electricity sector only sees a 67 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 relative
 to 2005 levels, which makes it much more difficult to meet the goal of reducing
 economy-wide emissions 50 percent by 2030. As a result, the transportation,
 buildings, and industrial sectors will have to cut emissions even more quickly
 to offset the lingering emissions from power plants, which is difficult when
 constrained by stock turnover. Some of the strategies for faster reductions,
 especially in the transportation and industrial sectors, are more costly, require
 a potentially unachievable pace of transformation, and carry other downsides,
 like the local air pollution, sustainability, and availability challenges of biofuels.

WHAT THE SLOW ELECTRICITY SCENARIO REQUIRES FROM THE OTHER SECTORS VS CORE SCENARIO


Transportation    Almost 450,000 more electric light-duty vehicles and 6,000 medium- and
                  heavy-duty vehicles on the road than in the Core scenario by 2030. In
                  addition, biofuels must replace even more fossil fuels (especially diesel),
                  composing 18 percent of total transportation energy demand in 2030,
                  compared to 7 percent in the Core scenario. Moreover, these additional
                  biofuels must be produced using carbon capture and storage to balance out
                  the emissions.


Buildings         375,000 more homes are all electric than in the Core scenario by 2030.


Industry          Biofuels make up 14 percent of industrial energy demand, compared to only
                  6 percent in the Core scenario.




  Colorado needs to eliminate the use of coal to serve electricity customers by 2025;
             delaying retirements to 2030 will make it more difficult to
                       meet the state’s economy-wide targets.



In each of the four decarbonization scenarios that Evolved modeled, Colorado’s
fossil fuel generation declines, driven by coal plant retirements and steep
declines in gas use. In the Core scenario, all coal units retire by 2025. This
scenario shows coal generating only 2 percent of the state’s electricity at the
end of 2024, then dropping to zero for 2025 and beyond. Figure 12 below
underscores the sharp and rapid drop in coal capacity in the Core, Fossil Free,
and Low Demand scenarios compared to the Slow Electricity and Reference
scenarios.

State policymakers and the state’s utilities must speed up coal retirements.
The model shows that the most cost-effective path is to retire all coal before
2025. If all coal units are not retired by 2025, they must be retired as soon after
2025 as possible and state policymakers must ensure that other sectors make
up the emissions difference. If the state’s coal plants are not all retired before
2030, it will be much harder and more expensive to achieve the 2030 statewide
goal because other costlier and more difficult reductions will need to take place
in the buildings, transportation, and fossil fuel sectors. The Slow Electricity case
illustrates this point as it is the most expensive scenario—even more expensive
than the Fossil Free case—warning of the serious cost implications of slow
electric decarbonization.

Similarly, gas utilization must drop significantly to meet the climate goals. The
Core scenario projects gas generation will provide 26 percent of the state’s
electricity in 2025, then drop sharply to 2 percent of electricity in 2030, and
finally reach only 1 percent in 2050. Again, this trend is in stark contrast with
the Reference scenario where fossil fuels could still generate 63 percent of
the state’s electricity in 2025, 69 percent of the state’s electricity in 2030, and




                        COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 51
   37 percent of the state’s electricity in 2050. Our results show that the current
   path of the electric sector is insufficient and strong new policy drivers will be
   necessary to accelerate decarbonization in the electricity sector to reach the
   state’s climate goals. The Low Demand and Fossil Free scenarios show almost
   identical declines in coal plants and gas use.

   In the Slow Electricity scenario, coal generation remains high in 2030, while gas
   generation is lower than in the other decarbonization cases. The remaining coal
   generation displaces generation from gas and a small amount of renewable
   energy.

   FIGURE 12.	 COAL CAPACITY FOR ALL MODELED SCENARIOS

   In the Core, Fossil Free, and Low Demand scenarios, coal capacity drops to near zero by
   2025. In the Slow Electricity Sector, coal capacity remains online for longer and drops to
   zero by 2035.

   While coal- and gas-fired power plants still dominate today’s generation
   mix in Colorado, the future decarbonized grid looks very different. Each
   decarbonization scenario we modeled shows a marked shift in electricity
   generation to reach the state’s economy-wide goals. Wind energy grows to
   represent the largest share of electricity in the state, solar output increases, and
   imports of clean energy elsewhere in the region grow to fill in the rest.

   All of the decarbonization scenarios project considerable growth in the
   electricity system. Compared to today’s levels, total electricity generation at
   least doubles by 2050 because of the significant electrification of buildings and
   vehicles required to decarbonize the other sectors. Figure 13 below displays




                                                             COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 52
the large jump in electricity generation and each resource’s contribution across
the modeled scenarios between now and 2050. The level of electricity growth
shown here is still less than it would be without energy efficiency measures,
discussed in more detail in the Buildings section of the report. Without the
level of efficiency represented in all the decarbonization cases, the challenge of
decarbonizing the grid would be even greater.

FIGURE 13. ELECTRICITY GENERATION FOR ALL MODELED SCENARIOS

In the Core, Slow Electricity, and Low Demand Scenarios, electricity output increases three-
to four-fold between 2020 and 2050, with most of that increase occurring after 2030. Coal
and gas generation, which presently dominates the grid, decline to near zero in the Core,
Low Demand, and Fossil Free scenarios. Instate wind generation expands dramatically in
all scenarios to become the largest source of electricity. Solar generation grows to become a
significant player in the decarbonized grid, and imports fill in the rest of the portfolio.

Renewable energy growth (and total electricity generation) is greatest in the
Fossil Free scenario by 2050, as shown in the right-hand graph in Figure 13.
Whereas the other scenarios allow a small budget for fossil fuel for hard-to-
decarbonize sectors (e.g., jet fuel for aviation), the Fossil Free scenario requires
the state (and the nation) to produce carbon-neutral fuels from non-fossil
inputs. Moreover, this scenario also requires replacement of all petrochemicals
and other fossil-fuel-based products with renewable, synthetic substitutes. As
a result, electricity supports an even greater share of the economy through
production of synthetic fuels that can directly replace refined fossil fuels.
Further reductions in energy demand (such as those included in the Low
Demand scenario) and product demand (such as plastics recycling) would
reduce the need for renewable energy growth, especially if those demand
reductions were targeted at hard-to-decarbonize sectors like aviation.




                                                COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 53
The state must begin building vast amounts of new renewable energy and
corresponding new transmission right away to replace fossil fuels and meet
growing electricity demand. Colorado currently has almost 4 gigawatts (GW)
of wind capacity and slightly more than 1 GW of solar capacity. In the Core
scenario, wind and solar collectively add 13 GW of new capacity in the 2020s,
more than tripling the existing wind and solar capacity. By 2030, about 97
percent of in-state electricity generation must come from renewables. When
you factor in imports, renewable energy meets 98 percent of the state’s
electricity demand in 2030. In the 2030s, the state must add another 17 GW of
new renewable capacity followed by an additional 14 GW in the 2040s.

All together, in the Core scenario, Colorado needs 28 GW of new wind and 16
GW of new solar by 2050—more than seven times as much wind capacity and
almost 15 times as much solar capacity as is currently on the system. That is
the equivalent of adding 0.9 GW of new wind (one fourth of the current wind
capacity) and 0.5 GW of new solar (half of the current solar capacity) each year
through 2050. Table 3 below outlines the growth in wind and solar capacity in
the Core and Reference scenarios between now and 2050 and highlights the
total renewable capacity difference between the Reference and Core scenarios
by 2050: a whopping 35 GW of renewables.

TABLE 3. WIND AND SOLAR CAPACITY IN THE CORE AND REFERENCE SCENARIOS

While both the Core and Reference scenarios see an increase in wind and solar capacity,
the Core scenario sees over three times more renewables built between now and 2050.

                                     2025      2030       2050

              Solar                  3.3        6.0       17.7

              Total Renewable        10.9       19.5      50.4

              Total Renewable        6.4        8.6       15.8



The additional efficiency and demand reduction measures in the Low Demand
scenario reduce the need for renewable energy buildout by about 0.2 GW per
year, compared to the Core case. That is a 15 percent reduction in the amount
that the sector needs to build. Conversely, in the Fossil Free scenario, renewable
energy builds more than double compared to the Core case, with the greatest
increase in the 2040s.

Energy storage also plays an important role in decarbonizing the grid. Figure
14 below showcases the contribution of storage on top of new power plant




                         COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 54
 capacity in the Reference, Core, Low Demand, and Fossil Free scenarios. While
 distributed solar and storage are not options in the model’s optimization,
 ensuring that some solar and storage is distributed will help harden the grid
 and increase resilience in the face of wildfires and other emergencies.

 FIGURE 14.	 NEW POWER PLANT CAPACITY IN SELECT MODELED SCENARIOS

 Construction of new wind, solar, and storage must accelerate significantly to meet the
 climate goals. Demand reduction and efficiency measures in the Low Demand case reduce
 the necessary amount of new capacity. The Fossil Free scenario requires significantly more
 new renewable energy and storage to provide electricity to produce synthetic fuels and
 products to replace all fossil fuels.

                                Deep decarbonization of the electricity sector drives significant
                                       reductions in pollutants harmful to human health.



 The decarbonization scenarios all reduce harmful air pollution from the
 electricity system, with the Slow Electricity scenario showing the smallest
 reductions. The magnitude of the benefits of air pollution reductions,
 including their impact on low-income communities, communities of color, and
 overburdened communities, will depend on the order in which the plants retire
 or reduce utilization.

 Air pollution from coal declines rapidly in the Core scenario, and pollution
 from gas power increases slowly by 2025 before declining to close to zero by
 2030. Figure 15 demonstrates the overall downward trajectory in electricity
 air pollution in the Reference, Core, and Slow Electricity scenarios. In the Slow

                       Electricity scenario, air pollution from coal remains high in 2030 because the
                       state keeps several coal-fired power plants online.

                       Pollution remains high in the Slow Electricity scenario due to ongoing operation of coal
                       units. In the Core case, emissions from coal drop to zero by 2025 because all coal retires by
                       2025, and emissions from gas then drop significantly between 2025 and 2030.

                       Colorado’s electricity sector pollution sources are disproportionately located
                       in low-income communities and communities of color. As shown in Figure
                       16 below, two thirds of the state’s fossil fuel power plants are located in
                       communities with higher-than-median low-income populations, and two thirds
                       are located in communities with higher-than-median census-defined minority
                       populations, with many located in both. Figure 16 plots the distribution of
                       plants among low-income communities and communities of color. The top
                       half of the plot shows higher levels of populations below the poverty line and
                       the right half of the plot shows higher levels of minority populations. The
                       concentration of circles (fossil fuel plants) in the top and top right of the plot
                       illustrates the prevalence of fossil fuel power plants in areas with more low-
                       income and minority populations.

It is essential to understand how policy pathways will affect emissions of
different air pollutants in these communities. Electricity-system SO2, NOx, and
mercury (Hg) pollution drop to near zero by 2030 in the Core, Low Demand,
and Fossil Free scenarios. By contrast, in the Slow Electricity scenario, the
power sector achieves only a 45 percent reduction in SO2, 61 percent reduction
in NOx, and 48 percent reduction in Hg, due to the lingering coal-fired
electricity. Prioritizing retirement of the most polluting plants—especially if the
state achieves slower power sector progress—is important to ensure pollution
reductions.

Not all plants have the same pollution impact, even within the same fuel class.
There is wide variation in air pollution emissions intensity among Colorado’s
coal- and gas-fired power plants, in part due to differences in technology
vintage and air pollutant control technologies. This variation, combined with
variation in plant location, means that different plants have different impacts on




                                                                                        COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 57
public health. Figure 17 below shows CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions from power
plants in 2019 alongside a map of power plants across the state. Reducing
emissions first from plants with high emissions rates, beginning with coal
facilities, will reduce pollution more rapidly. Another trend is that many of
Colorado’s gas plants are located in and around the Denver area, whereas the
state’s coal plants are in communities outside of Denver.

Coal plants show some variation in SO2 emission rates, and SO2 intensities are not well
correlated with CO2 intensity. Gas plants emit very little to no SO2 . Both coal and gas show
significant variation in NOx emissions rates, which again are not well correlated with CO2
emissions rates. Eliminating a ton of CO2 leads to reducing more health-harming co-
pollutants from some plants than from others. The years shown on the charts represent the
planned retirement for plants whose owners have committed to closing the plant.

Differences in air pollution intensity of coal plants are important for policy
decisions particularly if the power sector emissions do not decline as quickly
as in the Core scenario. If power sector decarbonization follows the pace of
the Slow Electricity scenario, air pollutant emissions could meaningfully vary
depending on the timing and sequencing of coal unit retirements. Prioritizing
the retirement of coal plants with high sulfur dioxide emission rates, for
example, could reduce 2030 emissions by roughly 15 percent, or more than
730 tons. The differences are less of an issue for coal if the state succeeds in
eliminating nearly all coal power by 2025 to meet its climate goals.

Our modeling suggests that some gas-fired power may remain in 2030 and
generate a small amount of electricity, even if the state meets its climate
goals. Many of Colorado’s gas plants are located in low-income communities,
communities of color, and areas that already face high levels of pollution
burden, including many in the federal ozone nonattainment area around Denver
(Figure 4 illustrates this trend earlier in the report). Decisions about which, if
any, gas plants remain online past 2030 will influence the extent to which these
communities continue to face disproportionate burdens from fuel infrastructure.


      The state can achieve the required transformation of the electricity system
               without large increases in average retail electricity costs.



Retail costs stay stable throughout the modeled time period, with little
difference between the Core and Reference cases, as shown in Figure 18.
The average electricity costs do not account for the variation in the bills that
individual consumers pay, including consumers’ energy burden (i.e., the share of
income devoted to energy costs).

Many households pay more than 10 percent of their income on energy
expenses, and low-income and rural households tend to be worse off, as shown
in Figure 19. Under the decarbonization scenarios, certain Coloradans will
continue to face high energy burdens without additional policy, reinforcing
the notion that reducing CO2 emissions from the electric sector is not, by
itself, sufficient to address the inequities in the state. State policymakers must
intentionally adopt targeted policies to ensure that electricity is affordable for
all Coloradans.

      TRANSPORTATION

      Colorado must build out a highly efficient and decarbonized transportation
      system to meet its near- and long-term climate goals. The transportation sector
      must shift from an inefficient system dominated by fossil fuels to a lower-
      consumption system powered primarily by clean electricity, supplemented by
      smaller amounts of green hydrogen, electrically produced fuels, and biofuels.
      Electrification of the vehicle fleet is the primary transportation decarbonization
      strategy in the near term. Transportation electrification has the potential to
      save people money on fuel costs, push down electricity rates (for example,
      by absorbing excess renewable generation that might otherwise have to be
      curtailed), and curb air pollution. Likewise, if done right, investments in public
      transit, rail, and smart urban design, such as those represented in the Low
      Demand scenario, can increase mobility and create safer, healthier, and more
      accessible transportation systems.




                                                                 COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 61
                  Transportation CO2 emissions must drop by at least 35 percent by 2030.



Our modeling shows that transportation-related CO2 emissions must drop
18 percent by 2025 and 35 percent by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. That is
equivalent to a 30 percent reduction from 2017 levels by 2030. Emissions
must then decline even more rapidly from 2030 to 2050, becoming net
negative7 by 2050 to meet the midcentury target. In our decarbonization
pathways, electrification, low-carbon fuels, and efficiency drive these emissions
reductions. Increased transit, walking, and biking also play a significant role in
the Low Demand scenario.

If the power sector does not achieve the level of reductions that occur in the
Core scenario, the transportation sector needs to decarbonize even more
quickly. In the Slow Electricity scenario, transportation emissions plummet
down to 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2025—reaching this level five years
earlier than in the Core Scenario—and 57 percent by 2030, nearly double the
level in the Core scenario. Figure 20 below shows the large emissions gap that
the transportation sector must fill through 2030 to make up for additional CO2
from the power sector in the Slow Electricity case, compared to the Core, Fossil
Free, and Low Demand scenarios.

FIGURE 20.	
           CO2 EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IN ALL MODELED
           SCENARIOS

Transportation emissions drop to at least 18 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and 35
percent below 2005 levels by 2030 in the Core, Fossil Free, and Low Demand scenarios. The
reductions in the next five years are small, as electric vehicle adoption is slowly accelerating.
In the Slow Electricity scenario, steep reductions begin immediately, and emissions drop to
35 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and 57 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

               Electric vehicle sales must make up the majority of new
                           light-duty vehicle sales by 2030.



Electrification is a key pillar of transportation decarbonization, and the
state must quickly electrify the vehicle fleet to meet the near- and long-
term economy-wide goals. This result was consistent across all the scenarios
analyzed.

The market for light-duty vehicles must shift rapidly for Colorado to meet its
climate goals. In scenarios where the state meets its targets, electric vehicles
make up at least 27 percent of new car sales and 8 percent of new light truck
sales by 2025 and 66 percent of new car sales and 40 percent of new light
truck sales by 2030. By 2035 or soon after, nearly all new cars and light trucks
should be electric. If the power sector decarbonizes more slowly than we
recommend, as demonstrated in our Slow Electricity scenario, then EV sales
must accelerate even more quickly, reaching 39 percent of new car and 14
percent of new light truck sales by 2025 and 85 percent of new car and 71
percent of new truck sales by 2030.

In the Core scenario, increased adoption of EVs leads to at least 220,000
electric cars and light trucks on the road by 2025 and 900,000 on the road
by 2030. Because EVs dominate the new vehicle market starting in the 2030s,
vehicle stock will turn over quickly in the 2040s as a growing share of people
buy EVs when replacing their old cars. As a result, 95 percent of on-road light-
duty vehicles are electric by 2050.

The fleet of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles must also electrify, though
on a slightly later timeline. To meet the state’s targets, electric vehicles and
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles make up at least 21 percent of new medium- and
heavy-duty trucks by 2030 and close to 100 percent by 2040. To reach the
2025 emissions goal and develop the technology and infrastructure to meet the
2030 target, clean truck adoption should grow in the next five years, reaching 4
percent of new sales by 2025. In our scenarios, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles play
a modest role in the 2030s and a larger role in 2040s, with double or triple the
number of medium- and heavy-duty trucks powered by batteries compared to
being powered by hydrogen fuel cells. In the Slow Electricity scenario, EVs must
make up almost 50 percent of new trucks by 2030 to help make up for greater
emissions in the power sector. Figure 21 below compares electric vehicles
growth as a percentage of all new vehicle sales from now to 2050 between the
Reference, Core, and Slow Electricity scenarios as well as the shift in vehicle
stock composition.

Electric and fuel cell options for heavy-duty trucks are currently limited by high
costs and limitations in performance, especially for long-haul trucks, which is
why adoption is slow until the 2030s, by when the technologies are expected
to have improved.

  Adoption of zero-emission vehicles must accelerate rapidly in the late 2020s and 2030s to meet
  the climate goals. In the Slow Electricity scenario, adoption must grow significantly in the next
  few years so that zero-emission technologies make up a significant share of new vehicles by 2030.

         Transportation electrification adds 5 TWh—equal to 6 percent of total load—
                                 to the electric sector by 2030.



Transportation electrification contributes to growth in electricity demand in
all modeled scenarios. Figure 22 below shows how in the Core scenario, newly
electrified vehicles increase electricity demand by 5 TWh by 2030, or about 6
percent of total electricity use. By 2050, the transportation sector uses 31 TWh
of electricity, roughly 16 percent of total electricity load in 2050.

In our decarbonization scenarios, Colorado takes advantage of flexibility
in operation of electric vehicles to help reliably meet load in a deeply
decarbonized electricity system. In the Core, Slow Electricity, and Fossil Free
scenarios, we assume that 50 percent of light-duty vehicle load can shift
up to eight hours, 50 percent of medium-duty vehicle load can shift up to
three hours, and 25 percent of heavy-duty vehicle load can shift up to three
hours. That means, for example, that 50 percent of the electricity required
to charge electric cars can shift a few hours later in the evening to avoid the
late afternoon peak in demand. Enabling this load flexibility requires policy
solutions, including strategic rate structures, to incentivize energy use to
improve grid operation.

FIGURE 22.	
           I NCREMENTAL ELECTRICITY LOAD FROM TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION

Though transportation electrification adds electricity demand, it only represents a small
share of load through 2030. By 2050, transportation makes up a more significant share of
total load. The load from transportation in the Reference case (the dark green wedge) is very
small.

Efficiency and demand-reduction measures (including managing the times
that electric vehicles are charged to maximize charging during off-peak
hours and/or during periods of excess renewable generation) can reduce
the impact of electrification on the electricity system. In the Low Demand
scenario, reductions in vehicle use result in 7 percent less electricity growth
from transportation by 2030 and 33 percent less by 2050. The Low Demand
scenario also maximizes load flexibility from electric vehicles, allowing 100
percent of LDVs and MDVs and 50 percent of HDVs to shift load. The demand
reduction measures and additional load flexibility help reduce the amount of
new wind and solar power plants that need to be built. Figure 23 below displays
the growth paths of electricity load attributable to transportation electrification
across all the scenarios.

Electricity load for transportation grows considerably in all decarbonization cases. The
Slow Electricity scenario grows the fastest in the near term. In the Low Demand scenario,
demand reduction measures reduce the incremental load from electrification.

       The state must decarbonize the remaining transportation fossil fuel use by 2050.



Electrification of the vehicle fleet accounts for a significant portion of the
transportation sector transformation, but the sector also requires carbon-
neutral fuels to meet the energy demand that will be difficult or impossible
to electrify. Some medium- and heavy-duty trucking applications will likely
remain difficult to meet with electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and some
air travel is likely to remain impossible to directly electrify. Decarbonizing these
transportation applications requires the buildout of infrastructure to produce
and use carbon-neutral or low-carbon fuels.

  Our analysis found that the state can decarbonize the remaining fossil fuel
  use with biofuels and synthetic fuels produced with green hydrogen, captured
  CO2, and clean electricity. These synthetic fuels are called “power-to-gas” and
  “power-to-liquids.” In the Core scenario, the transportation sector decarbonizes
  mainly with electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels, only relying on a small amount
  of synthetic fuels. In the Fossil Free scenario, the available biomass sources are
  needed for other hard-to-decarbonize sectors (e.g. replacement feedstocks
  for petrochemical products) so the transportation sector requires a greater
  quantity of synthetic fuels. Notably, combustion of biofuels still produce
  harmful air pollution—especially particulate matter and nitrogen oxides—and
  should therefore be used sparingly, and emissions from biofuels should be
  minimized and mitigated near vulnerable populations. Figure 24 below shows
  the types of fuels used for transportation and the increasing portion of non-
  fossil fuels.

  In our modeling, all biofuels are produced with sustainable biomass feedstocks.
  For the state to credibly reduce emissions using biofuels and avoid harm to
  ecosystems, policymakers must ensure that all biofuels are produced with
  biomass that is independently certified to the Roundtable on Sustainable
  Biomaterials (RSB) or equivalent standard.

  Transportation energy use, currently dominated by refined fossil fuels, must shift
  dramatically to meet the state’s climate goals. Electricity grows to become the largest energy
  source, and biofuels, synthetic fuels, and hydrogen fill in the rest. Synthetic fuels make
  up a greater share of fuel use in the Fossil Free scenario, in which the limited supply of
  sustainable biomass is needed for other hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

            The transportation system must become much more efficient,
                   especially with demand reduction investments.



Investments to reduce transportation service demand can substantially affect
the amount of clean energy production required to meet the climate goals. A
decarbonized transportation sector would use significantly less energy than the
present system, even as service demand (e.g. vehicle miles traveled) increases.
As a result, the modeled 2050 transportation sector uses less than half the
energy of today’s system in the scenarios where the state meets its climate
targets.

The demand reduction investments in the Low Demand scenario lead to even
lower energy use, reducing the infrastructure necessary to produce electricity
and synthetic fuels for transportation. In the Low Demand scenario, Coloradans
rely more on public transit, walking, and biking and less on personal vehicles.
As a result, it uses 64 percent less energy in 2050 than today’s system.


   Meeting the climate goals will cut harmful pollution, but the remaining pollution
            will still be inequitably distributed without targeted policies.



In the Low Demand scenario, light-duty vehicle miles traveled is 7 percent
lower than the Core scenario in 2030 and 35 percent lower in 2050. Heavy-
duty vehicle miles traveled is 4 percent lower in 2030 and 20 percent lower in
2050. As a result, the Low Demand transportation system uses 33 percent less
electricity and 25 percent less synthetic fuel than in the Core scenario in 2050.

The decarbonization scenarios all reduce health-damaging air pollution from
the transportation sector. While the Reference case projects increases in
pollution through 2050, the decarbonization scenarios show substantial cuts
from the Reference case and a decline to near-zero emissions by 2050 for all
pollutants except PM10. Substantial PM10 emissions remain from tire and brake
wear from vehicle use. In the Core scenario, PM2.5 emissions from vehicles
decline by 1 percent from 2020 to 2030, ending up 7 percent lower than the
Reference case in 2030. Similarly, NOx emissions decline by 3 percent from
2020 to 2030 and are 9 percent lower than the Reference case in 2030. NOx
pollution declines most rapidly in the Slow Electricity scenario because of faster
electrification, while PM10 drops fastest in the Low Demand scenario because
of reduced miles travelled.

FIGURE 25. 	 AIR POLLUTION FROM ON-ROAD VEHICLES IN ALL MODELED SCENARIOS

Air pollution from on-road vehicles decline significantly in all scenarios compared to
the Reference case. Unlike other pollutants, PM10 emissions are not reduced to near-zero
in 2050. Electric vehicles still produce PM10 due to tire and brake wear, as well as the
resuspension of dust and other particulate matter on road surfaces.

Pollution from the transportation sector is inequitably distributed, and these
inequities are likely to remain in place even with reductions in total pollution.
For example, NOx emissions from on-road vehicles across Colorado are higher
in communities with a higher fraction of low-income people, people of color,
and linguistically-isolated populations, as shown in Figure 26 below.

   These charts show the ranking of census tracts by PM2.5 emissions from vehicles, alongside
   population and percentage of the population that are low-income or a racial minority. The
   bar on the far right represents the 20 percent of census tracts with the highest emissions, and
   the left-most bar represents the 20 percent with the lowest emissions. The darker teal portion
   of the bar represents the population that is either low-income or a racial minority. The dark
   teal portion is larger on the right-hand side of the charts, meaning transportation-related
   PM2.5 emissions are more dense in census tracts with higher census-defined minority and
   low-income populations. This trend is true for all criteria air pollutants we analyzed (NOx ,
   PM2.5, PM10, CO) as well as VOCs (criteria air pollutant precursors).

While the Core scenario reduces total statewide criteria air pollutant emissions
compared to the Reference case and today’s levels, emissions still increase in
certain areas of the state from 2020 to 2030. Vehicle miles travelled increases
in all scenarios except the Low Demand scenario, which will lead to increased
pollution without sufficient adoption of zero-emission vehicles. Because heavy-
duty and medium-duty trucks electrify more slowly than light-duty vehicles,
PM2.5 emissions increase from 2020 to 2030 in rural areas where heavy-duty
and medium-duty trucks make up a larger fraction of vehicle miles traveled.
Urban areas that are in close proximity to interstate highways also see an
increase in PM2.5 from 2020 to 2030 in the Core scenario, as depicted in Figures
27 and 28 below. Along these same interstate corridors, residual NOx and PM2.5
emissions remain in 2050 in the Core scenario due to the use of biodiesel for
medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.

As the communities living in close proximity to urban interstate highways tend
to have a higher percentage of low-income households and people of color,
the increase in criteria air pollutant emissions over this time period and residual
emissions in 2050 mean that pollution will continue to disproportionately
burden these communities without policies to specifically address this issue.
Although the projected increase in pollutant emissions, lingering emissions
levels, and associated inequities are worse in the Reference scenario than in the
Core case, the results suggest that achieving the state climate targets alone
will not ensure equitable outcomes or guarantee the elimination of harmful
pollution for all Coloradans.

           PERCENT CHANGE IN PM2.5 EMISSIONS FROM ON-ROAD VEHICLES FROM 2020
           TO 2030 IN CORE CASE

Transportation-related PM2.5 emissions increase in many rural areas from 2020 to 2030.
This is largely due to medium and heavy-duty trucks, which electrify at slower rates than
light-duty vehicles while vehicle use increases. Some areas that experience increases,
especially in eastern Colorado, have high socioeconomic vulnerability, as shown by high
scores on the Demographic Index. The increases in emissions are smaller than those in
the Reference case. Data Sources: FHWA 2018 Highway Performance Monitoring System,

In the Low Demand scenario, criteria air pollutant emissions from vehicles
decline in all regions of the state from 2020 to 2030, due to investment in
public transit and other measures that reduce vehicle miles traveled across
vehicle classes. In this scenario, as in the other decarbonization scenarios,
pollution from biodiesel-powered trucks persists in 2050, albeit at a lower level
than in the Core scenario.

Prioritizing investment in electric charging infrastructure along urban interstate
highway corridors, rerouting heavy-duty and medium-duty trucks to less
populated areas, electrifying heavy-duty trucks and equipment serving
warehouses and industrial sites, replacing some heavy-duty freight with rail,
and incorporating certain measures from the Low Demand scenario could help
to address equity issues associated with the increase in PM2.5 emissions from
2020 to 2030 in the Core scenario.

                            The average Coloradan would spend less money on transportation in a
                         decarbonized world, but policies are needed to ensure the economic benefits
                                               are more equitably distributed.



Colorado can decarbonize the transportation sector while cutting personal
transportation costs for the average driver. As seen in Figure 29 below, in
the scenarios where the state meets its climate goals, the per capita cost of
personal travel declines 1 to 2 percent by 2030 and 10 to 16 percent by 2050.
This includes all personal energy and vehicle costs as well as the energy
costs for passenger rail and aviation (a much smaller component of costs).
Transportation costs remain very close to the Reference case through 2030 and
then 6 to 12 percent below the Reference case by 2050. The cost reductions
come primarily from reduced fuel use, because the per-mile cost to power an
electric vehicle is lower than the per-mile cost to power an internal combustion
engine vehicle.

             SCENARIOS

Transportation costs do not change significantly through 2035, after which costs decline in
the decarbonization cases, ending up 6 to 12 percent lower than the Reference case by 2050.

While the reduction in average transportation costs is promising, these cost
numbers do not represent the variation in costs between households, and do
not convey the cost burden that these expenditures represent for households
of different income levels. Access to these cost savings requires drivers to be
able to purchase an electric vehicle and have access to vehicle charging. Figure
30 below shows the Colorado electric vehicle adoption rate by zip code median
household income. The current distribution of EV registrations in Colorado
suggests that, in the absence of additional government policies, EV adoption
will likely continue to occur faster among higher-income households and low-

                    and moderate-income households will be less likely to buy an EV in the near
                    term, which could deepen the inequitable distribution of the savings from EVs.

                    Even if EVs are adopted equitably across households, lower-income households
                    will spend a greater fraction of their annual income on transportation fuel
                    costs in each of the scenarios, much as they currently do today. Figure 31
                    below illustrates this by showing how on average, the percentage of household
                    income that is spent on transportation fuel from weekday travel increases
                    exponentially as household income declines.

     Given that higher-income households typically have more access to and greater
     rates of ownership of cars than lower-income households, many low-income
     households would especially benefit from policies which support the build-out
     of public transit and walkable communities. In addition, policy measures that
     incentivize electrification by penalizing people that continue to use gasoline
     vehicles can exacerbate the differences in energy burdens between households
     that can afford EVs and those that cannot.



     BUILDINGS

     Colorado must create a highly electric and efficient building sector to
     meet its climate goals. Doing so requires shifting from fossil fuels to clean
     electricity to heat our homes and offices, ensuring that new buildings are
     made with highly efficient shells, increasing adoption of efficient appliances,
     and upgrading the existing building stock. Colorado’s residential building
     stock is expected to expand considerably in the coming years, so policies
     and technologies must address both new and existing buildings. Making the
     required changes to the state’s building sector will also cut health-damaging
     pollutants, though additional planning and policies are needed to ensure that
     all Coloradans, including those who rent or live in mobile homes, can afford
     and access building upgrades. While these changes to the building sector can
     be accomplished without significantly increasing total costs, the high energy

 burden that many Coloradans face will persist without targeted policies to
 address these inequities.


                           Emissions from buildings must drop 10 to 33 percent
                              by 2030 and sharply decline to zero by 2050.



 In our modeling, Colorado’s buildings sector contributes modest emissions
 reductions to meet the 2025 and 2030 climate goals and much deeper
 reductions to meet the 2050 target. Building sector emissions are expected to
 increase absent new policy, so the state must reverse this trend if it is to meet
 its climate goals. Our Core scenario shows that emissions from the buildings
 sector must decrease by 10 to 13 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 to meet the
 near term climate goals, assuming that the power sector decarbonizes quickly.
 If the power sector moves more slowly, as in the Slow Electricity scenario,
 then emissions from buildings must decline much more rapidly, achieving a 9
 percent reduction by 2025 and a 33 percent reduction by 2030, compared to
 2005 levels. Figures 32 and 33 outline CO2 emission reductions from residential
 and commercial buildings respectively and highlight the gap between the Core
 scenario and Slow Electricity scenarios.

 CO2 emissions from homes are expected to rise absent new policy. In the decarbonization
 scenarios, this trend reverses and residential buildings achieve modest reductions by 2030
 and deep reductions by 2050. The Slow Electricity scenario requires much more rapid
 decarbonization by 2030.

                   Meeting the climate goals requires replacing fossil-fuel-fired heating and
                          cooking systems with highly efficient electric appliances.



Electrification is a key strategy to decarbonize Colorado’s building sector.
While today’s building stock relies significantly on direct use of gas, wood, and
heating oil, building energy use must shift almost entirely to electricity by 2050.
Getting there requires dramatically increased adoption of electric heat pumps
for space and water heating and electric ranges for cooking.

Adoption of electric appliances must grow rapidly to meet the near-term
targets and ensure that the building stock fully transforms in time to meet
the 2050 requirement. Figure 34 below showcases the percentage of new
residential and commercial appliances that are electric in the Core, Slow
Electricity, and Reference Cases. In the Core scenario, we see electric space
heaters in residential buildings must make up 49 percent of new sales by
2030 and 95 percent by 2040 to meet the state’s targets. Residential water
heaters must follow a similar trajectory, with electric appliances making up 47
percent of new sales by 2030 and 99 percent by 2040. These adoption curves
for the Core scenario require only addressing new appliances and appliances
to replace burned-out old appliances—this scenario does not require retiring
existing appliances earlier than planned. However, if adoption does not ramp
up quickly, meeting the climate goals will require early retirement of appliances
that have not exceeded their useful life.




                                    COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 78
This level of electrification is the equivalent of requiring all new homes to be
all electric by 2031 and then replacing 2 to 3 percent of non-electric space
heaters and 4 to 5 percent of non-electric water heaters with electric heat
pumps in existing homes each year through 2040. Note that these numbers
represent only one way to get to emissions reductions necessary from the
buildings sector; for example, an alternative would be to accelerate retrofits of
existing buildings prior to 2030, which would likely be more costly, but in which
case fewer new homes would need to be all-electric.

Figure 34 also shows that the Slow Electricity scenario requires the same
pace, but starts sooner in the space and water heating market to make up for
the lower reductions in the electricity sector. In the Slow Electricity scenario,
electric appliances must make up 87 percent of new sales by 2030 for space
heating and 90 percent for water heating. That’s the equivalent of ensuring that
all new homes have electric space and water heating by 2026 and thereafter
replacing 2 to 3 percent of non-electric space heaters and 4 to 5 percent of
non-electric water heaters with electric ones each year. We assumed that
residential buildings, rather than commercial ones, help make up for reduced
emissions from the power sector because residential emissions are significantly
greater and therefore have greater potential for reductions.

Commercial buildings must follow a similar trajectory. By 2025, 12 percent
of new commercial space heater sales, 4 percent of new commercial water
heater sales, and 58 percent of new commercial stove sales must be electric.
By 2030, 36 percent of space heater sales, 30 percent of water heater sales,
and 91 percent of stove sales are electric in all scenarios in which the state
meets its climate goals. By comparison, about 6 percent of commercial space
heater sales, 2 percent of commercial water heater sales, and 46 percent of
commercial stove sales are electric today.

 Adoption of electric heat pumps must accelerate dramatically over the next 10 to 15 years
 for the state to meet its climate goals. In the Slow Electricity case, the adoption curve is even
 steeper to enable deeper cuts to emissions by 2030.

 As a result of these shifts, electricity must meet a growing share of building
 energy demand, while fossil fuel use in buildings declines. Figure 35 shows that
 by 2050, only a small amount of fossil fuel and wood use remains in the Core
 scenario compared to the Reference scenario. The total building energy use
 also declines, as a result of the energy efficiency measures described below
 and the fact that efficient electric appliances use much less energy to provide
 the same services.

 In our decarbonization scenarios, Colorado takes advantage of flexibility in
 operation of these newly electrified loads to help reliably meet load in a deeply
 decarbonized electricity system. In the Core, Slow Electricity, and Fossil Free
 scenarios, we assume that 50 percent of residential space heating and air
 conditioning load can shift one hour forward or backward and 50 percent of
 water heating load can shift two hours forward or backward. We also assume
 50 percent of commercial space heating load can shift one hour forward or
 backward. That means, for example, that 50 percent of the electricity required
 to cool Colorado homes in the summer can shift a few hours earlier in the
 day to soak up the extra solar generation during that time period and reduce
 demand in the evening. The Low Demand scenario maximizes load flexibility

 from buildings, allowing 100 percent of space and water heating to shift.
 Enabling this load flexibility requires policy solutions to incentivize energy use
 to improve grid operation.

 FIGURE 35.	 FUEL TYPES USED TO MEET BUILDING ENERGY DEMAND IN THE CORE AND
              REFERENCE CASES

 In the Core scenario, electricity grows to provide the vast majority of building energy use,
 a marked shift from the current system, which relies significantly on fossil gas. Total energy
 use declines significantly because of efficiency measures and the greater efficiency of electric
 appliances.

                                             The state must ensure that new buildings are efficient
                                                     and existing buildings are upgraded.



 Making the building stock more efficient is critical to meet the state’s climate
 goals. Figure 36 shows that building energy use is 5 percent lower in the Core
 scenario than in the Reference case in 2030 and 37 percent lower in 2050,
 thanks to energy efficiency measures. In the Low Demand scenario, the savings
 are even greater: 9 percent lower than in the Reference case in 2030 and 44
 percent lower in 2050. These savings reduce the amount of new clean energy
 and new electricity distribution infrastructure that is necessary to meet the
 climate goals. Moreover, they create healthier, safer, and more comfortable
 buildings for all Coloradans, when complementary equitable policies are put in
 place.

     The building energy savings come from
     three major categories: 1) adoption of highly
     efficient appliances, 2) ensuring that new
     buildings have highly efficient envelopes,
     and 3) upgrading existing buildings to
     minimize energy losses.

     As discussed in the previous section, the
     market for space heating, water heating, and
     cooking appliances needs to move rapidly
     toward highly efficient, electric options.
     For other energy-using appliances—such
     as air conditioning, refrigeration, and
     clothes washers and dryers—the existing
     stock is already mostly electric. For these
     appliances, the core strategy is to transform
     the market such that highly efficient
     (and electric) options are the norm and
     eventually take up the whole market. High
     efficiency technology does not currently
     have high deployment in the marketplace,
     but Figure 37 below shows that in order to
     meet Colorado’s climate goals, adoption
     of high efficiency appliances must grow to
     more than 80 percent of new sales by 2030.

In addition to replacing the appliance stock with efficient, electric equipment,
Colorado must also ensure that new buildings have highly efficient envelopes.
Colorado’s residential building stock is expected to grow 16 percent by 2030
and 45 percent by 2050, based on projections from the 2019 Annual Energy
Outlook from the U.S. Department of Energy. High construction rates make the
new construction opportunity a must win in Colorado and ensuring new homes
are highly efficient will curb the added energy demand from building growth.

Retrofitting existing buildings to improve building envelope efficiency is also
part of the solution. These retrofits should include a package of upgrades8 to
make the whole building more efficient, such as improved insulation, air sealing,
windows and doors, and air ducts. In the Core scenario, Colorado retrofits
28,000 homes per year in the mid 2020s, 51,000 homes per year in 2030, and
about 70,000 homes every year through 2050. That is equal to upgrading 1 to 2
percent of existing homes per year in the 2020s and 2 to 2.5 percent per year in
the 2030s and 2040s.

The Low Demand scenario includes an even larger retrofit program to upgrade
all existing buildings by 2050. Doing so requires a retrofit rate of 67,000 homes

8	 The upgrades described here are designed for a Maine context, but the specifications are applicable to Colorado, as well.




                                                                              COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 83
    per year through the early 2030s, 120,000 homes per year through 2040, and
    140,000 every year in the 2040s. That represents 2.7 percent of homes per year
    in the 2020s, a little more than 4 percent per year in the 2030s, and 4.5 percent
    per year in the 2040s. Figures 38 and 39 illustrate the scale of residential
    building upgrades required in the Core and Low Demand scenarios.

    shells by 2050, driven both by adoption of efficient shells for new buildings and retrofits of
    existing buildings. The Low Demand scenario includes a more significant retrofit program
    to upgrade every residential building with an efficient shell by 2050.

        Incremental building electrification adds 2 TWh (3 percent of total load) to the
           electricity system by 2030 and 24 TWh (12 percent of total load) by 2050,
                            but efficiency measures reduce the impact.



Electrifying buildings at the rate required to meet the state climate goals
contributes to growth in electricity demand. In the Core scenario, building
electricity use grows by 5 TWh from today’s levels by 2030, with 2 of those
TWh coming from additional electrification beyond business-as-usual. That
represents a 10 percent increase from today’s electricity use in buildings. Figure
40 shows that by 2050, building electricity demand grows to 84 TWh, a 74
percent increase from today’s levels.

Buildings represent the vast majority of electricity demand today. In the Core scenario,
building electricity demand grows as more buildings electrify. Electricity demand for the
transportation and industrial sectors also grows considerably, so that buildings make up a
much smaller share of load in 2050.

Additional investment in energy efficiency can reduce growth in electricity
demand. Figure 41 showcases that the Low Demand scenario results in 20
percent less electricity growth than in the Core scenario by 2030 and 25
percent less by 2050.

             While overall pollution will decrease if the state achieves its climate goals,
            dangerous pollution from biomass will persist unless specifically addressed.



Burning fossil fuels and biomass in homes produces health-harming pollutants.
Decarbonizing buildings through efficiency and electrification will significantly cut
pollution, but some pollution will remain without specific policies to address it.

The major pollutants from home energy use are PM2.5 and NOx. Buildings are a
major source of PM2.5 pollution, exceeding PM2.5 emissions from power plants
and vehicles in Colorado. Residential PM2.5 emissions are most substantial in
rural areas (largely due to biomass burning), especially where wood is burned
for home heating. About 40,000 households in Colorado currently use wood
as a primary heat source. A fraction of PM2.5 emitted from wood burning may
remain indoors, posing a significant health hazard to Colorado residents that
use wood for heating, primarily in rural areas

Buildings are a smaller but still significant source of NOx pollution. Residential
NOx emissions are highest in urban areas (largely due to natural gas use).
Though NOx emissions from transportation, power plants, and industrial
facilities are much greater than those from buildings, some residential NOx
emissions are indoors and have a greater direct impact on human health. Figure
42 shows the distribution of PM2.5 and NOx emissions across the state.

NOx emissions from gas use are highest in urban areas, though some rural areas also have
high levels of NOx pollution.

The Core and Low Demand scenarios significantly cut NOx pollution compared
to today’s levels and the Reference case. However, these scenarios do not
reduce the high levels of PM2.5 and VOC pollution from continued use of
wood for space heating, as shown in Figure 43. Our modeling assumes no
changes to wood burning. Reducing the use of wood for home heating—
such as by switching to electric heat pumps and investing in more efficient
building shells—would reduce particulate matter emissions and improve health
outcomes.

Efficiency is also key to reducing fuel use and GHG emissions, but efficiency
upgrades that seal buildings without proper ventilation can exacerbate
health impacts, so it is important to couple efficiency measures with proper
ventilation. Electrification reduces these dangerous emissions and thereby
improves indoor and outdoor air quality and health outcomes. Efficiency can
also help maintain comfortable indoor temperatures and protect vulnerable
populations from both cold snaps and heat waves.

FIGURE 43.	 AIR POLLUTANT EMISSIONS BY FUEL TYPE FROM RESIDENTIAL SOURCES

Total pollution increases in the Reference scenario. In the Core and Low Demand scenarios,
NOx pollution declines significantly due to reduced gas use, but PM2.5 and VOC pollution
remains high because of continued use of biomass as a primary home heat source for many
households.

The decarbonization scenarios also cut other harmful pollutants (including
carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide) from buildings, though the greatest
reductions are to NOx pollution. Figure 44 shows NOx emissions decreasing
substantially compared to the Reference scenario but emissions of other
pollutants decreasing only slightly due to the continued use of biomass (e.g.,
wood) in residential heating.

                                Decarbonization will reduce total pollution from residential buildings,
                                   but some communities will still experience pollution increases
                                          without targeted policies to ensure reductions.



Residential pollution will grow across Colorado if the state continues business-
as-usual. In the Reference case, air pollution increases in all parts of Colorado
through 2050. The Core scenario reverses this trend and reduces statewide
pollution, but some communities still experience increases in pollutant
emissions from present levels through 2030. Residential pollution also increases
in some rural communities through 2050 due to continued use of wood
for heating. The Low Demand scenario avoids these increases and ensures
emissions reductions across the state through additional measures to reduce
fuel use. In the Low Demand case, emissions increase through 2030 for some
rural areas but then drop below current levels by 2050 across the state. Figure
45 shows these trends.

  Air pollutant emissions from residential buildings increase across the state in the Reference
  case. Air pollutant emissions increase from present levels for some rural communities, even
  with the decarbonization measures in the Core scenario. The Low Demand scenario ensures
  a reduction in pollutant emissions from present levels for all census tracts by 2050.

                             The state can meet its emissions targets with only slight increases in home energy
                              costs. Targeted policies will be needed to address disparities in energy burdens.



 The decarbonization cases result in slight increases in building energy costs for
 Coloradan households. Even though the increases are small, low-income people
 already pay a disproportionate amount of their income on energy costs, and
 decarbonization could perpetuate these inequities without targeted policies.

 In the decarbonization scenarios, building energy costs are about 7 percent
 higher than the Reference case in 2030 and 2050, as shown in Figure 46.
 These costs include the cost of energy used within residential buildings (e.g.,
 electricity and fuel), as well as the capital and installation costs of energy-using
 appliances and the costs of building shell upgrades.

 FIGURE 46.	 AVERAGE PER-HOUSEHOLD COST FOR RESIDENTIAL ENERGY NEEDS

 The decarbonization scenarios result in modest increases in residential energy costs
 per household. The costs in this figure include the costs of electricity, fuel, purchase and
 installation of energy-using appliances, and building shell upgrades.

 Today, many households spend more than 5 percent of their income on energy
 for their homes, and some households (especially in rural areas) have to spend
 10 to 15 percent of their incomes for home energy use. Energy burden rises
 exponentially as income decreases, and rural households tend to have higher
 energy burdens. Energy efficiency reduces energy consumption thereby
 reducing energy bills and decreasing energy burdens. However, low-income
 families, particularly in multifamily homes, are often least likely to participate in
 efficiency programs and have efficiency upgrades because of unique issues like
 dispersed or complex building ownership, split financial incentives between the
 building owner and tenants, lack of financing, and lack of awareness of options.

     And yet, it is low-income households who would often benefit most from the
     reduction in energy-related expenses, the decrease in energy waste, and the
     improved health benefits provided through energy efficiency.

     FIGURE 47.	 BASELINE RESIDENTIAL ENERGY BURDEN IN 2017

     Energy burden rises exponentially as income decreases. Energy burden is calculated from
     median household fuel and electricity consumption for home energy use by census tract,
     average cost of fuel and electricity, and median household income by census tract.

     Areas with high energy burden also overlap to some extent with communities
     that rank high on the Demographic Index, particularly for census tracts in
     southern and eastern Colorado, as shown in Figure 48. Energy burden is
     particularly high in southwestern Colorado. While the Denver area has lower
     energy burden than rural parts of the state, the parts of Denver with higher
     energy burden also have high Demographic Indices, as shown in Figure 49.
     These types of maps can be used to screen for census tracts that have both
     high energy burdens and high cumulative socioeconomic burdens.

    Average energy burden remains similar to today’s levels in most of the
    decarbonization scenarios, as shown in Figures 50 and 51. The Low Demand
    scenario results in lower energy burdens compared to other scenarios. Rural
    areas see the highest increase in energy burdens in the Reference case, and all
    four decarbonization scenarios mitigate these increases in energy burden for
    rural communities.

OIL & GAS PRODUCTION

To achieve the climate goals, Colorado must ensure substantial reductions in oil
and gas (O&G) methane emissions. The state must cut O&G methane about 57
percent from pre-pandemic levels (54 percent from 2005 levels) by 2030 and
at least 89 percent from pre-pandemic levels (88 percent from 2005 levels) by
2050.

Upstream methane emissions O&G are the largest source of the state’s
industrial greenhouse gas emissions, and they have grown significantly over the
past 15 years due to large increases in production. O&G methane made up 14
percent of the state’s total GHG emissions in 2005. According to pre-pandemic
estimates, today’s O&G methane emissions represent 18 percent of total GHGs
emitted in Colorado.

The core strategies to reduce O&G methane are to reduce the rate of leakage
from the extraction, processing, transmission, and distribution of oil and gas
and to reduce total O&G production. Colorado should pursue a combination of
these strategies.

                   Colorado must reduce oil and gas methane emissions 57 percent by 2030
                            and at least 89 percent by 2050 from present levels.



O&G methane emissions must drop sharply in the next 10 years and steadily
decrease through 2050. This is a significant departure from business as usual, in
which O&G methane emissions climb over the next decade, peaking 52 percent
higher than 2005 levels, and then decline through 2050. Figure 52 shows that
O&G methane emissions in our Core scenario are very similar to the methane
projections in the HB-1261 Action scenario of the GHG Roadmap. However, the
Roadmap and our analysis show different technical pathways for achieving
these reductions.

FIGURE 52. 	 OIL AND GAS METHANE EMISSIONS IN GHG ROADMAP AND CORE SCENARIO

The GHG Roadmap baseline shows an initial, substantial rise in methane emissions and
never reaches the level of emissions reduction as the Roadmap’s HB-1261 scenario and our
Core scenario.

In Evolved’s analysis, the reduction in oil and gas emissions is achieved through
both a decrease in oil and gas production and a reduction in methane leakage
rates. In the Core scenario, O&G output drops 25 percent from 2019 levels
by 2030 and 75 percent by 2050, as shown in Figure 53. In the Fossil Free
scenario, output drops to zero by 2050.

By contrast, the GHG Roadmap argues that the state can substantially increase
production (by 41 percent for gas and 86 percent for oil between 2020 and
2030) and still achieve the necessary methane reductions. However, the
state’s analysis is counting on unprecedented reductions in methane leakage,
as shown in Figure 54. The GHG Roadmap assumes the leakage rate drops
from 2.4 percent today to 0.6 percent in 2030 and 0.3 percent in 2050. In our




                                     COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 96
analysis, the leakage rate drops to 1 percent in 2030 and 0.7 percent in 2050,
based on the EPA’s Global Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections &
Mitigation: 2015-2050.

FIGURE 53. 	 OIL & GAS PRODUCTION IN THE GHG ROADMAP AND OUR ANALYSIS

Both the Roadmap Baseline and HB-1261 scenarios show a significant increase in oil and
gas production and maintain higher overall levels of production between now and 2050, in
sharp contrast with our Core and Fossil Free scenarios.

While we would welcome Colorado’s O&G industry achieving the levels
of reductions in leakage rates assumed by the GHG Roadmap, we are
concerned that the leakage rate reductions in the Roadmap may not occur
without significant new regulations and resources devoted to monitoring and
enforcement. In addition, expansion in the oil and gas industry means more
pollution will remain in Coloradan communities.

By contrast, our modeling shows a steep decline in instate O&G production
is necessary to meet the HB-1261 targets. Colorado should ensure modest
reductions in O&G production by 2030 and steeper reductions through 2050
both as part of a strategy to reduce methane emissions and to be consistent
with instate emissions reductions and reduced oil and gas use throughout
the west. By assuming that oil and gas production continues to expand
significantly, the Roadmap envisions a future in which the state cuts emissions
from in-state demand, only to export a growing amount of fossil fuels for
combustion elsewhere. We believe an approach that combines leakage rate
reductions with production decreases is more consistent with the necessary
reductions in O&G use to ensure emissions reductions across the country. A 25
percent reduction in oil and gas production is comparable to the reduction in
oil and gas use that occurs across the western states in the Core scenario.

Strategies to reduce production must ensure protection and economic support
for communities that are dependent on fossil fuel extraction and processing.
By acknowledging the need for production declines to avoid the worst climate
impacts and planning ahead for this future, the state can more readily and fully
support these communities and work with them to find adequate solutions.

                       Expanded production will exacerbate pollution harmful to human health.



Pathways to cutting GHG emissions while leaving oil and gas production in
place will continue to produce harmful co-pollutants, such as benzene. Oil and
gas production can also contribute to water contamination and limit water
access to local populations. Certain measures, such as set-backs, can help
limit these impacts, but even with these measures, expanded production will
continue to have pollution impacts on the state’s rural communities.

INDUSTRIAL ENERGY USE AND PROCESSES

The state must cut industrial CO2 emissions by at least 27 percent from today’s
levels (still 6 percent higher than 2005 levels) by 2030 and 72 percent from
today’s levels (58 percent from 2005 levels) by 2050. These reductions should
come from decreased fossil fuel production (which reduces energy use),
alongside energy efficiency, electrification, and adoption of low-carbon fuels.

Industrial CO2 emissions made up 11 percent of the state’s total GHG emissions
in 2005, with industrial energy use accounting for most CO2 from the industrial
sector and process emissions (emissions not associated with energy use)
making up the rest. Industrial CO2 pollution has grown in the past 15 years,
comprising about 15 percent of the state’s total GHG emissions today. These
emissions include CO2 produced from the non-electricity energy supply for
all industrial sectors, including oil and gas production and processing, as well
as CO2 released in industrial processes (e.g. CO2 as a byproduct of chemical
processes used to produce cement). They do not include methane leakage from
oil and gas, which are discussed in the previous section.


     Colorado’s industrial energy use is dominated by oil and gas production, but
             manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and several other
                     industries also are significant energy users.



Colorado has a diverse industrial sector, so specific strategies to decarbonize
industrial energy use will vary based on the specific subsector in question. Oil
and gas production, processing, and refining use more energy than any other
sector by far. These activities account for about half of all industrial energy use.
The next largest subsectors by energy use are manufacturing, construction,
agriculture, mining, and food and beverage production, as shown in Figure 56.

The manufacturing subsector includes several major industries. The largest
manufacturing subsectors by energy use are chemicals, iron and steel,
and cement and lime. Figure 57 shows the distribution of energy use by
manufacturing subsector.

All industrial subsectors rely heavily on fossil fuels for energy supply. The oil
and gas industry relies almost entirely on burning gas for energy. Construction
and agriculture both use substantial diesel fuel, along with other energy
sources. Electricity is an important energy source for manufacturing and
mining, in particular. Figure 58 breaks down fuel use by subsector.

                                        Colorado must cut CO2 emissions from the industrial sector by 27 percent
                                                 by 2030 and 72 percent by 2050 from today’s levels.



 Reductions in CO2 emissions from industrial energy use are necessary for
 Colorado to meet the climate goals. In the Core scenario, industrial CO2
 emissions drop to about 17 MMT CO2 (27 percent lower than today’s levels and
 5 percent higher than 2005 levels) by 2030 and 7 MMT CO2 (72 percent lower
 than today’s levels and 58 percent lower than 2005 levels) by 2050, as shown
 in Figure 59. The Slow Electricity scenario requires even greater reductions in
 the next ten years, reaching 13 MMT CO2, 43 percent below today’s levels and
 17 percent below 2005 levels. These additional cuts help offset slower progress
 in the power sector, though at a greater cost than if the power sector moves as
 quickly as in the Core scenario. The Fossil Free scenario achieves even greater
 cuts to industrial CO2 emissions by 2050, as industrial facilities replace all fossil
 fuel use and petroleum-based feedstocks with synthetic fuels, biofuels, and
 biomass or synthetic feedstocks.

FIGURE 59. CO2 EMISSIONS FROM THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN ALL MODELED SCENARIOS

The Core, Fossil Free, and Low Demand scenarios show a largely similar reduction path
between now and 2050, with the Fossil Free scenario ultimately achieving net negative
emissions from biofuels with carbon capture and sequestration. The Slow Electricity
scenario makes even greater reductions in the next ten years to offset the slower progress in
the power sector.

                 The industrial sector must become more energy efficient and replace fossil
                            fuel use with electricity, synthetic fuels, and biofuels.



To achieve the required reductions in CO2 emissions, Colorado must upgrade its
industrial facilities with more efficient technologies and practices and replace
fossil fuel use with alternative zero- or low-carbon energy sources.

In the Core scenario, industrial energy demand drops to 24 percent below
today’s levels by 2050. That’s 45 percent below the Reference case, in which
industrial energy demand continues to climb. These reductions come from less
oil and gas production (which means less energy used to operate oil and gas
production and processing facilities), combined with more efficient practices
across the industrial sector.

Direct use of fossil fuels (burning fuels on site to meet energy demand)
currently supplies 87 percent of industrial energy use, and only 12 percent
comes from electricity, as shown in Figure 60. In the Core scenario, electricity
use grows to comprise 23 percent of energy demand by 2030 and 52 percent
by 2050. Biofuels, which play a trivial role in today’s industrial system, also
supply a growing share of energy demand, reaching 8 percent by 2030 and
17 percent by 2050. These fuels replace current uses of diesel in industry. The
Slow Electricity scenario relies more heavily on biofuels to achieve the greater




                                   COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 103
reductions necessary by 2030. Biofuels make up 14 percent of industrial energy
demand by 2030.

While the other decarbonization cases allow for some fossil fuel use to remain
in 2050, the Fossil Free scenario requires the industrial system to fully rely
on electricity, biofuels, and synthetic fuels. In this case, electricity supplies 71
percent of energy, synthetic fuels supply 20 percent, biofuels provide 6 percent,
and hydrogen fills in the remaining 2 percent. The Fossil Fuel scenario also has
greater reductions in total energy demand, in part due to even less oil and gas
production in 2050.

In our modeling, all biofuels are produced with sustainable biomass feedstocks.
For the state to credibly reduce emissions using biofuels and avoid harm to
ecosystems, policymakers must ensure that all biofuels are produced with
biomass that is independently certified to the Roundtable on Sustainable
Biomaterials (RSB) or equivalent standard.

FIGURE 60. INDUSTRIAL FUEL USE IN MODELED SCENARIOS

The Core, Slow Electricity, and Fossil Free cases all drastically reduce overall levels of fuel
use and the portion of fossil fuel use, while increasing the portion of electricity between now
and 2050 compared to the Reference case.

               Decarbonizing industrial energy use will help reduce harmful air pollution.



Industrial facilities, including oil and gas infrastructure, release harmful air
pollution through industrial processes and fossil fuel use for energy. Existing
industrial pollution is concentrated in communities of color and low-income
communities (e.g., Figure 61). Replacing fossil fuel use in industry will help
reduce emissions in overburdened communities. However, burning biofuels and



                                        COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 104
 synthetic fuels still releases harmful air pollution, so some industrial pollution
 will remain, even in the Fossil Free scenario.

                                  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS




The policy recommendations listed below are informed by Evolved’s energy
system modeling and PSE Health Energy’s equity analyses. They are broken
down by sector and include specific complementary recommendations for
addressing equity.

While each equity recommendation is tailored to the specific sectors, four
broad themes emerged from the equity analysis as a whole:
    •	 First, pollution sources are not spread evenly across the state and tend to
       be concentrated in low-income communities and communities of color.
       Thus, policies are needed to prioritize pollution reductions in communities
       with the heaviest pollution burdens.
    •	 Second, there is unequal support for the access to, and adoption of, clean
       energy technologies, particularly distributed energy resources such as
       energy efficiency, rooftop solar, and electric vehicles. We must take steps
       to ensure that all communities have access to, and benefit from, clean
       technologies.
    •	 Third, some Coloradans have very high energy burdens, spending large
       shares of their income on electricity and transportation. Reducing GHGs
       will not, by itself, address these energy burdens, and thus complementary
       policies are needed to make energy and transportation more affordable.
    •	 Fourth, we need more demographic data and analyses of affordability and
       access to clean technologies. Relatedly, policymakers have a duty to ensure
       that communities disproportionately affected by pollution are included
       in the process of devising and implementing policy solutions, that their
       rules decrease harmful air pollution and co-pollutants in disproportionately
       impacted communities, and that they provide ongoing tracking of emission
       sources.9 Currently, there is no explicit direction in the statute for how to
       do so, so mechanisms for collecting, sharing, and requiring the use of the
       communities’ input is needed.

Finally, an important consideration for the implementation of all policies will
be funding. Policies that can secure robust funding particularly for low-income
programs and programs for people of color, enable revenue generation, and
staff the personnel needed can be the difference between successful or
unsuccessful implementation. One barrier that will need to be addressed for
sufficient funding is Colorado’s Taxpayer’s Bill of Right (TABOR) amendment,
which prohibits state and local governments from raising tax rates and
spending revenues collected under existing tax rates without voter approval if
revenues grow faster than the rate of inflation and population growth.

  •	 Electric sector CO2 emissions decline by 98 to 99 percent by 2030 relative
     to 2005 levels
  •	 Absolute CO2 emissions budget for 2030: approximately 0.6 MMT CO2
  •	 This is functionally equivalent to a 98 percent RPS standard for 2030


THE IMPORTANCE OF ACHIEVING RAPID AND DEEP DECARBONIZATION
OF THE ELECTRIC SECTOR

Our modeling indicates that reductions in the electric sector are some of the
lowest-cost GHG emission reductions on a dollar-per-ton basis compared to
measures for reducing GHG emissions from all other sectors. As a result, the
least cost option is to maximize reductions from the electric sector. If close
to complete decarbonization by 2030 does not occur, other sectors have to
pick up the slack and the state’s climate goals will be much more expensive to
achieve.

The Slow Electricity scenario illustrates how if Colorado’s electric sector does
not rapidly decarbonize by 2030, meeting the economy-wide 2030 target
will be more expensive, more difficult, and have more negative consequences.
The costs in the Slow Electricity scenario are higher overall than the Core
decarbonization case in both 2025 and 2030 and have higher cumulatives cost
than any other scenario. Furthermore, the Slow Electricity Scenario leaves high
levels of health-damaging air pollutant emissions on the grid in 2030.

The pace of electric sector decarbonization is also critical because it affects
the magnitude of emission reductions achieved in sectors that are electrified,
e.g., transportation and buildings. Thus, the benefits of electrifying vehicles and
buildings increase as the electric grid decarbonizes.

RECOMMENDATION 1: ADOPT A CARBON EMISSIONS RULE FOR ELECTRIC
UTILITIES

Relevant Agency: AQCC
Recommendation Details: The AQCC should issue a rule requiring each utility
to do the following:
  1.	 Reduce CO2 emissions 80 percent by 2025;
  2.	 Reduce CO2 emissions by at least 90 percent by 2030;
  3.	 Submit a plan to the AQCC with mass-based CO2 emission limits for each
      of their CO2-emitting generating units, with such limits becoming legally
      enforceable if the AQCC approves the plan as reducing emissions 75
      percent by 2025 and 90 percent by 2030;
  4.	 Include in the emissions calculations and budget the CO2 emissions
      associated with electricity imported into Colorado to serve Colorado
      customers;
  5.	 Include in the emissions calculations and budget any CO2 emissions
      associated with electrification of other sectors;
  6.	 Retire Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) in the year generated and avoid
      double-counting of RECs for compliance with both HB-1261 and other
      states’ emission targets;
  7.	 Prioritize emission reductions in communities with high pollution burdens,
      to maximize reductions in harmful co-pollutants such as SO2, NOx, and
      PM; and
  8.	 Ensure remaining gas generation is not located in frontline communities.

  1 & 2: Set Carbon Reduction Targets for All Electric Utilities

In our Core Decarbonization scenario, the modeling results show that the
electric sector reduces its CO2 emissions 75 percent by 2025 as part of the
state achieving the 26 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2025, and shows
that the electric sector reduces CO2 emissions 98 percent by 2030 to achieve
the 50 percent reduction in statewide GHGs by 2030. This translates to a CO2
emission budget for the electric sector of approximately 10 million metric tons
in 2025 and 0.8 million metric tons in 2030.

The statewide GHG reduction targets in HB-1261 are science-based targets:
they are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s
recommendation for reducing GHG emissions to avoid the worst impacts
of climate change. By contrast, the 80 percent by 2030 target in a CEP has
no basis in scientific studies or in any analyses of the reductions needed to
achieve the statewide targets. Our results show that it is unlikely we can reduce
statewide emissions by 50 percent by 2030 if the electric sector as a whole
reduces its CO2 emissions by only 75 or 80 percent by 2030.




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 108
We recognize that HB-1261 essentially precludes the AQCC from requiring
additional emission reductions from a utility under HB-1261 if it has an approved
CEP and the AQCC has made certain findings regarding the CEP. Nonetheless,
issuing the rule we recommend for the electric sector can drive emission
reductions for utilities that choose not to submit a CEP.

The AQCC should coordinate its electric sector rule under HB-1261 with other
rulemakings to encourage and/or require utilities to take steps to reduce their
CO2 emissions 75 percent by 2025 and 98 to 99 percent by 2030. The AQCC
proposed to address both regional haze and HB-1261 requirements in a single
rulemaking this fall, and this represents an opportunity to ensure that certain
power plants reduce their CO2 emissions consistent with the statewide targets
in HB-1261.

  3. Translate the Emission Reductions Into Enforceable Emission Limits

We recommend that the AQCC approve legally-enforceable emission limits for
each CO2-emitting facility of each electric utility. The AQCC should do this for
both utilities that submit a Clean Energy Plan and those that do not.

The AQCC should require that, within six months of the AQCC adopting a final
electric sector rule, a utility must either submit a Clean Energy Plan to the PUC
or submit a plan to the AQCC for meeting the emission limits listed above,
i.e., 75 percent reduction by 2025 and at least 90 percent by 2030. A plan
submitted to the AQCC should include annual, mass-based CO2 limits for each
generating unit, and such CO2 limits would become legally enforceable after
AQCC approval of a plan.

Any electric-sector rule should describe how the AQCC will verify the emissions
a utility actually emits under a CEP and whether the utility’s actual emissions
result in a 75 percent and 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 (the
statutory targets for a CEP). We recommend that the AQCC adopt a rule that
the projected 2030 emissions in a CEP that is approved and verified to meet
the statutory requirements become enforceable, mass-based CO2 emission
limits for each generating unit covered by the CEP. This rule should also specify
the process and standards for dealing with a utility that does not achieve
the minimum emission reductions required by a CEP (i.e., a 75 percent or 80
percent reduction in emissions by 2030).

Ensuring that electric utilities’ plans are legally enforceable is critical to
implementing HB-1261, because it is possible that utilities will retain some gas-
fired generators through 2030. Thus, utilities will have fossil-fuel generators
that, if run at sufficiently high capacity factors, could cause the utilities to
exceed the emission reductions promised in CEPs. Absent a mechanism for
monitoring and enforcing emissions from electric utilities, there is no guarantee
that a utility will run its generating units to stay below the emission reductions
promised in a plan.

  4. C
      ount Emissions Associated with Imported Electricity Toward Each
     Utility’s Emission Budget

It is our understanding that the state’s Roadmap Study is not counting GHG
emissions associated with electricity that is imported into Colorado to serve
Colorado customers. This raises concerns given that one of the state’s largest
electric utilities, Tri-State, serves Colorado customers with significant amounts
of electricity from coal-fired power plants located outside Colorado, including
Laramie River Station in Wyoming, Springerville in Arizona, and coal units
owned by Basin Electric Power Cooperative. According to Tri-State, under a
business-as-usual trajectory, Tri-State’s out-of-state power plants would emit
roughly 2.5 million tons of CO2 in 2025 and 2.9 million tons of CO2 in 2030 to
generate electricity to serve Colorado customers.

Ignoring emissions associated with imported electricity is problematic for
many reasons. It results in undercounting the total emissions associated with
providing electricity to Colorado customers. It also incentivizes Colorado
utilities to outsource electricity production, and the associated pollution
thereof, to other states, creating an inequitable pollution burden shift to non-
Coloradans.

In its rulemaking, the AQCC should ensure that the required level of emission
reductions is calculated based on including emissions associated with
electricity imported to serve Colorado customers.

  5. Count Emissions Associated with Electrification in Each Utility’s
     Emission Budget

Our analysis indicates that in order to meet the statewide GHG reduction
targets, we must both decarbonize the electric sector rapidly and electrify
the transportation and buildings sectors. There have been proposals to allow
electric utilities, in the context of a Clean Energy Plan, to subtract the emissions
due to electrification from their emission target. This proposal would make
it harder to achieve the targets in HB-1261, because to meet the targets, the
electric sector must almost completely decarbonize by 2030. Thus, if the
electric sector achieves the level of decarbonization that our study indicates is
needed, the incremental emissions from electrification would be negligible. The
bottom line is that the AQCC should not be adjusting electric utilities’ baseline
or allowable emissions to subtract emissions from electrification, which is
incompatible with the scale of reductions needed from both the electric sector
and other sectors.

  6. Ensure No Double-Counting of Renewable Energy Credits

Colorado’s Clean Energy Plans and any other electric sector decarbonization
requirements should require the contemporaneous retirement of renewable
energy certificates (RECs) to ensure the renewable energy used to cut carbon




                       COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 110
by Colorado utilities are not also counted toward compliance with renewable
energy portfolio standards in other states.

    7 & 8. Require Utilities to Prioritize Emission Reductions in Communities
            With High Pollution Burdens

HB-1261 requires the AQCC to identify disproportionately impacted
communities10 and, in issuing rules to achieve the emission reduction targets,
consider “pollution abatement opportunities in disproportionately impacted
communities.”11 The AQCC should implement these statutory obligations by
requiring each utility to prioritize emission reductions in disproportionately
impacted communities and to consult with disproportionately impacted
communities when creating their resource plans. Given that the generating
units that emit CO2 also emit harmful “conventional” pollutants, our
recommendation can help reduce “conventional” pollution from the remaining
fossil fuel plants and ensure that the fossil fuel plants that remain operating
are not located in frontline communities, which typically experience multiple
environmental burdens and are more vulnerable to the impacts of pollution.
The PUC also has an important role to play in ensuring that utilities prioritize
retirement and/or reductions in use of fossil fuel plants in communities with
disproportionate pollution burdens. Specifically, the PUC should make this an
important goal in utilities’ resource plans.


RECOMMENDATION 2: INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SAVINGS TARGETS
FOR UTILITIES

Relevant Agency: PUC
Recommendation Details:
   In proceedings for Xcel and Black Hills, the PUC should ensure the following:
   1.	 Increase the energy efficiency savings target, budget, and measure
       incentives,
   2.	 Specifically, increase the residential savings target, budget, and measure
       incentives for low-income and low-income multifamily customers, and
   3.	 Target customers with high energy burdens, high pollution burden, and
       those having difficulty paying their bills.

    1. Expand cost-effective energy efficiency programs

Energy efficiency is often the most cost effective way to serve a customer’s
electricity needs, even before the inclusion of non-energy benefits. Studies have
shown energy efficiency programs ranging from 2 to 5 cents per kWh with an
average of 2.8 cents per kWh, making their cost about one half to one third the
levelized cost of alternative new electricity resource options, such as gas plants.


10	 Section 25-7-105(1)(e)(III), C.R.S. 2019
11	 Section 25-7-105(1)(e)(VI), C.R.S. 2019




                                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 111
Colorado has two electric investor-owned utilities that submit demand-side
management programs (DSM) to the PUC for review and approval: Xcel and
Black Hills. Xcel is the state’s largest electric utility, serving more than 1.4 million
customers and delivering more than half of the electricity used in the state.
The Commission should set the expectation that utilities like Xcel and Black
Hills must be maximizing their energy efficiency programs to capture nearly
all, if not all, cost-effective energy efficiency. This translates into expanded
budgets for these programs, increased incentive offerings, pursuit of whole
building envelope measures beyond lighting, and tailored program design to
help increase participation. Beyond Xcel and Black Hills, the Commission should
push Tri-State to work with its members to increase incentives, measures
offered, delivery options, and overall participation in energy efficiency
programs. Collectively, the state is currently achieving 1.07 percent demand
savings per year, but other states have been able to reach nearly three percent
savings. The PUC should expect and encourage utilities to maximize energy
efficiency savings.

To complement maximizing energy efficiency, demand-side management plans
must also provide ways to increase flexible load and demand response services.
In a future decarbonized electricity system, flexible electricity loads will be
more important than ever to help integrate renewable resources and ensure
a reliable electricity system. Moreover, load flexibility will be critical for cost-
effective electrification so as to avoid costly pressure on the electricity grid.

    2 & 3. Expand energy efficiency programs for low-income customers

Households with the highest energy burdens also tend to be the households
with the lowest carbon footprints. This means the households that pay the
highest shares of their incomes for electricity tend to be the households using
the least electricity and fossil fuels and emitting the least carbon.

The implication for climate policy is that focusing solely on reducing carbon
will not, by itself, reduce the energy burden for families with the highest energy
burdens. Instead, complementary policies are needed that specifically alleviate
the disproportionate energy burdens borne by some households.

Energy efficiency programs specifically targeted at low-income customers can
be one of these complementary policies and would be especially timely since
the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a staggering
increase in the number of customers who are behind on their electricity bills.
For example, in July, Xcel reported that slightly more than 130,000 residential
customers have a past-due electric bill.12

While the pandemic has increased the number of utility customers behind on
their bills and at risk of disconnection, electricity affordability was a problem

12	 Comments of Public Service Company of Colorado at 21, Proceeding No. 20M-0267EG (July 10, 2020).




                                  COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 112
for many households before the pandemic, and it will likely remain a problem
after the current economic crisis related to the pandemic. By reducing
customers’ energy usage and hence bills, energy efficiency programs can
help make electricity more affordable in the long run for customers who are
currently struggling to pay their bills. Data from Xcel also show that low-income
energy efficiency programs have the highest cost-to-benefit ratio of any energy
efficiency programs, saving roughly three dollars for every dollar that is spent.13

We recommend that the PUC require utilities to develop and implement
programs that would target energy efficiency services for customers who
are behind on their bills and may be at risk of having their electric service
disconnected.

We also recommend that the PUC approve significantly-expanded energy
efficiency programs for both single-family and multifamily low-income
customers, and that these programs be designed to overcome the many
barriers that low-income customers typically face such as split incentives
for renters, upfront costs, and cumbersome and confusing processes.
Considerations should include adopting utility performance metrics
that encourage continued program evolution toward delivering more
comprehensive, whole-building savings and electrification, direct financial and
technical assistance (as opposed to tax credits) for the installation of energy-
efficiency solutions in low-income homes, increasing eligibility opportunities for
low-income/income qualified programs, creating a health and safety program
to address health and structural issues preventing energy efficiency projects,
increased incentives and streamlined processes for building owners, and
making the delivery of programs as simple as possible.



RECOMMENDATION 3: EXPAND LOW-INCOME CUSTOMERS’ ACCESS TO
DISTRIBUTED SOLAR AND STORAGE

Agencies: PUC, AQCC, legislature

Recommendation Details: Colorado’s low-income households lag behind in
access to rooftop solar: the households with the 20 percent lowest incomes
represent only 3 percent of all rooftop solar installations, while the households
in the top 20 percent income bracket represent 49 percent. The benefits of
rooftop solar include cost savings and consistent bills, and yet the lowest-
income households, which have the highest energy burdens, rarely access these
benefits. Some reasons for this include the upfront costs to install rooftop solar
and the fact that lower-income households are more likely to rent than to own
their home. Along with increased access to solar, coupling solar with storage
will be increasingly important to provide resilience as climate-induced heat

13	 See, e.g., [cite to Xcel filing in 2021-2022 DSM plan].




                                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 113
waves lead to dangerously high temperatures and may lead to outages induced
by wildfires or other natural disasters and weather events.

Explicit policies are needed to provide access to capital or otherwise target
funds and projects toward these households (e.g., carve-outs, enhanced
financing, educational outreach across multiple languages, working with
landlords and property management companies). In consultation with the PUC,
the AQCC should work with disproportionately impacted communities and low-
income communities on how to increase access to residential solar and storage.
HB-1261 already requires the AQCC to solicit input from disproportionately
impacted communities when adopting policies to implement the statute. We
believe that discussions around increasing low-income customers’ access
to residential solar and storage should be part of the AQCC’s engagement
with disproportionately impacted communities (which is required by HB 19-
1261). It would also behoove the AQCC to explore ways in which to couple
complementary policies and processes such as electrification and EV
outreach to streamline the process and capitalize on as many clean energy
improvements all at once.

We also believe that the PUC could play a role by opening an investigation into
barriers to low-income customers’ adoption of residential solar and storage and
making outreach to low-income customers a part of such an investigation. The
PUC could also improve low-income customers’ ability to take advantage of the
community solar gardens offerings. The PUC should require utilities to increase
community solar garden capacity either reserved or prioritized for low-income
subscribers and direct utilities to increase marketing to low-income customers
of community solar garden offerings.

Examples of programs working to address customer access to clean energy
technologies include California’s SGIP program which includes an equity and
equity resiliency budget, the Single Family Affordable Homes Program, the
Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing, and New York’s MW Block program.


RECOMMENDATION 4: CREATE TRANSITION PLANS FOR WORKERS
AFFECTED BY THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS

Agencies: PUC, Office of Just Transition
Recommendation Details: Our modeling indicates that retiring all coal plants
in Colorado by 2025 is a key element of the most cost-effective path to meet
Colorado’s climate goals. Coal plants have been providing jobs and funding for
state and local government needs including overall state budget as well as local
schools, roads, sewers, and bridges. A just and equitable transition of workers
will need to include at a minimum local capacity for planning, dislocated worker
wages and benefits, and the implementation of transition plans in collaboration
with those affected by this transition, including those representing impacted
communities, workers, and labor unions. The opportunity for new jobs, as well




                     COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 114
as the economic development and diversification that comes with building a
clean regional economy are abundant and should be central to state decision
making to ensure that Colorado’s workforce reaps the benefits. Funding and
coordinating with Colorado’s Office of Just Transition will be key to ensuring a
fair and equitable transition to a cleaner economy.

                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 115
RECOMMENDATION 1: ADOPT CLEAN MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY TRUCK
RULES

Relevant Agencies: CDPHE, CDOT, CEO

Recommendation Details: Under the Clean Air Act, Colorado is able to adopt
California’s Advanced Clean Truck (ACT) and Omnibus rules by reference,
which would require truck makers to sell an increasing number of clean, zero-
emission trucks in place of dirty diesel and gasoline.

Earlier this year, CDPHE, CDOT, and CEO took a step in the right direction by
signing a multi-state Memorandum of Understanding to work collaboratively
to advance the market for electric trucks and buses. As a result, there will be a
public process to work with industry and community stakeholders to develop a
broad set of strategies to reduce emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. It will be
important to develop a broad-based coalition and partnership—including labor,
environmental justice, utility, EV industry, and consumer advocates—to support
strong standards for commercial trucks including a clean medium rulemaking
coupled with a Heavy-Duty “Omnibus” rule. Complementary measures must
simultaneously be adopted on clean trucks and buses including charging
infrastructure policies and incentives. The AQCC together with CDPHE should
develop the rulemaking with input and coordination with the Governor’s office,
CDOT, and the CEO.

ACT: A Colorado Advanced Clean Truck rule would require manufacturers who
sell trucks in the state to ensure that, on average, 30 to 50 percent of new
commercial truck sales are zero emissions by 2030 (depending on the weight
class) and reaching 40 to 80 percent by 2035. Compliance is determined based
on manufacturers generating credits for selling electric trucks and using those
credits to meet their overall credit requirement. The state and stakeholders
will need to work to defend against proposals that result in a weak Colorado
program relative to California’s and work to ensure that only zero-emission
vehicles offered for sale in Colorado generate compliance credits.

With regard to data collection, fleet reporting requirements will supply
invaluable information on truck operations, providing vital insight for informing
future policies. It should be noted that the ACT rule’s reporting threshold is
currently structured for California’s larger truck market. If possible, it will need
to be adjusted downward for Colorado’s smaller on-road truck fleet to provide
appropriate granularity.

Finally, it is important that Colorado quickly adopt California’s Advanced Clean
Truck rule to capitalize on the associated benefits as soon as possible. If the
timeline is stalled and further delayed by manufacturer lead time requirements,
additional compliance model years could be missed.

Heavy-Duty Omnibus Rule: California adopted new criteria pollutant standards




                       COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 116
from heavy-duty conventional, internal combustion engine trucks. Reducing
truck emissions by a similar order of magnitude in Colorado will result in
significant public health benefits. This rulemaking is a complementary standard
to an ACT rule in Colorado and should ideally be pursued simultaneously by the
AQCC and CDPHE.

Complementary Policies: Paired with the ACT and Omnibus rule, the state
should support the development of a robust market for zero-emission medium-
and heavy-duty vehicles through complementary strategies such as a fleet
purchase requirement, infrastructure investments, and incentives for technology
adoption.

Equity Considerations: These combined rulemakings will reduce harmful fossil
fuel emissions in communities throughout the state. However, communities
near highways or industrial hubs—which are predominantly communities of
color and low-income communities—have for years disproportionately suffered
from air pollution from diesel trucks. Negative impacts in these areas could
be addressed by: prioritizing electrification infrastructure to replace trucks
along polluted urban highways; supporting the electrification of heavy-duty
trucks and equipment at warehouses and industrial facilities in overburdened
communities; relocating bus terminals and yards away from already
overburdened communities; and limiting the amount of time buses and trucks
can idle.


RECOMMENDATION 2: FACILITATE INVESTMENT IN EV CHARGING
INFRASTRUCTURE

Relevant Agencies: PUC

Recommendation Details: The Public Utilities Commission should direct
investor-owned utilities to propose new tariffs that allow them to design, install,
and maintain electrical infrastructure and all associated work on the utility side
of the meter for all transportation electrification customers outside of single-
family homes. In many jurisdictions, these investments are referred to as “utility-
side make-ready infrastructure.” In this model, the utility can own, install, and
maintain the utility side of the make-ready system. Equipment covered includes
the transformer and conductor, as well as the trenching, repaving, and conduit
to the utility meter. The only elements not covered are the customer-side make-
ready and actual charging station.

Make-ready infrastructure can reduce a major barrier to widespread
transportation electrification at a scale that has the potential to put significant
downward pressure on rates and remove a significant and non-controversial
issue from individual utility program applications that must be litigated
repeatedly. It can also level the playing field between participants in utility
infrastructure programs and customers not covered by these programs,




                       COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 117
improve certainty for independent market participants, and provide a
foundation upon which other utility or state programs can facilitate the build
out of transportation electrification infrastructure.

This utility-side make-ready requirement would be layered on top of last year’s
SB 77, which directed utilities to file applications for programs and investments
that could include make-ready infrastructure. This tariff would be additive by
making the provision of necessary electrical distribution infrastructure on the
utility side of the meter the normal course of utility business. The tariff would
obviate the need to litigate the same issue multiple times in the applications
SB 77 contemplates and provide support to all customers instead of only
to customers participating in utility infrastructure programs, as is the case
now, thereby leveling the playing field. The tariff would also take hundreds of
thousands of dollars out of the costs of installing charging stations for electric
vehicles of all types at a typical site, providing a foundation of support upon
which independent firms, state programs, and targeted utility programs can
build out the charging network Colorado needs to meet its air quality and
climate goals.

Equity Considerations: The PUC should ensure programs are created to enable
access for multifamily as well as low-income buildings. Outside of homes, the
PUC should also prioritize investment in smart charging capabilities and EV
charging infrastructure along urban interstate highway corridors and frequently
visited locations such as grocery stores, libraries, and hospitals.


RECOMMENDATION 3: SUPPORT ADOPTION OF ZEV STANDARDS FOR
2026 TO 2035

Relevant Agencies: AQCC, CDOT, CEO

Recommendation Details: The Low Emission Vehicle and Zero Emission Vehicle
(LEV/ZEV) programs and goals created over the last few years in Colorado
were critical first steps to reach the levels of electric vehicles we need by 2030,
but more work remains. LEV/ZEV programs require automakers to increasingly
sell electric cars and trucks and have been adopted by multiple states across
the country. Colorado will need to work with all the other LEV/ZEV states to
ensure that the waiver allowing California, and thereby allowing other states,
to pursue more ambitious standards is reinstated. Once reinstated, all states
must ensure the rule is extended beyond 2025 and that the level of ZEV sales
sufficient to reach state goals.

Strong 2026 to 2035 ZEV standards will be considered for adoption in
California by the end of 2021 and Colorado decision makers will have an
opportunity to adopt these standards in 2022. In preparation for the adoption
of and alignment with California’s standards, there should be a push for at
least a 50 percent sales target by 2030 and virtually 100 percent sales by 2035




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 118
(including plug-in hybrids in addition to battery electric vehicles). Ensuring that
the technical feasibility, economic, equity, consumer market, and environmental
studies and analysis occur in 2021 (with stakeholder engagement) will also be
important in laying the groundwork for adoption by CDPHE in 2022.

Equity Considerations: A key priority for decision makers should be to ensure
that adoption of the ZEV standards will ultimately reduce transportation costs,
particularly for low-income families and communities of color, and will expand
access to zero emission vehicles, as well as other forms of clean mobility. In
addition to overcoming the incremental upfront costs, policies must reform
EV incentives in Colorado to increasingly be income-based and focused on
accessibility over time. Simultaneously, decision makers must also ensure
that charging infrastructure programs prioritize investments in underserved
communities and communities of color.


RECOMMENDATION 4: REFORM THE GAS TAX

Relevant Agencies: Legislature, DMV

Recommendation Details: We recommend that the legislature pass a new bill
to revise the tax on gasoline in order to remove disincentives for electric vehicle
adoption and create a simple, efficient, and stable source of transportation
funding. Fuel-based taxation that encourages reduced fuel consumption
and improved efficiency better corresponds with the “user pays” principle,
appropriately placing a price on pollution. Beginning in 2022, and every year
thereafter, state and local motor-fuel taxes should be indexed to the Consumer
Price Index and total fuel consumption. The Colorado Department of Motor
Vehicles should be tasked with assessing annual fees on alternative fuel vehicles
not otherwise subject to motor-fuel taxes based on the following formula: ($/
gallon state motor fuel tax) * (1/the US EPA’s miles per gallon equivalent rating
of the vehicle in question) * (annual miles driven by the vehicle as reported
to the DMV or, in the case of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, the estimated
number of reported annual miles reported to the DMV that were driven on
electricity).

Equity Considerations: From a pollution standpoint, improving fuel economy
disproportionately benefits low- and moderate-income households because
currently they bear disproportionately high effects of air pollution. However,
low-income households may only benefit financially if they can actually afford
more efficient cars. If not, those driving older, inefficient vehicles may end
up locked into paying increasing amounts for transportation. This risk makes
accessibility to cleaner and all-electric vehicles even more important. Until
electric vehicles are truly accessible to all and adoption rates are higher among
low- and moderate-income families, financial assistance programs will be
necessary to ensure that low- and moderate-income households can afford
more efficient vehicles.

RECOMMENDATION 5: INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSIT OPTIONS

Relevant Agencies: CDOT, City Governments

Recommendation Details: Recognizing that vehicle electrification alone is
insufficient to reach ambitious climate goals, state and local governments
must implement innovative programs that increase low-carbon transportation
choices over single-occupant vehicles, such as high-quality transit and
widespread access to walk- and bike-friendly communities. Plans to use state
funding, policies, and coordination/planning capacity to reduce vehicle use
and associated emissions will be critical to ensure we reach our targets. Local
and state transportation funds should prioritize low-carbon mobility options
through greenhouse gas performance/vehicle-miles traveled planning and
spending criteria and also use funding to incentivize municipal governments
to land-use and zoning decisions that help reduce vehicle use and cut
emissions. Cities themselves can also play a role by piloting innovative demand
management strategies such as pricing to further incent use of transportation
choices other than solo driving. Additional policies include electrifying city
fleets and buses, promoting commuter incentives, congestion pricing, building
more affordable housing near transit, and expanding bicycle and pedestrian
networks.

Equity Considerations: When discussing public transit, urban settings often
come to mind first, but it is important that policymakers do not leave rural
communities behind. Rural households spend 7 percent more of their budgets
on transportation compared to their urban counterparts. Rural workers also
travel 38 percent more than urban workers, and low-income rural workers travel
59 percent more. Colorado is already the national leader in rural transit, and
continuing to invest in these systems can help close the divide between rural
and urban travelers. Additionally, if transportation options are convenient and
reliable, rural and low-income people could avoid some vehicle costs.


RECOMMENDATION 6: ADOPT A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD

Relevant Agencies: AQCC, CDOT, CEO

Recommendation Details: A low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) drives low-
carbon innovation beyond what might occur with a price signal alone. LCFS is
a technology-neutral, performance-based greenhouse gas emissions standard
for fuels which works by limiting, and over time reducing, the amount of
greenhouse gases that can be emitted per unit of transportation energy sold.
The standard does not limit the amount of energy, just its carbon intensity,
to encourage the use of cleaner fuel sources. Gradually decreasing the
intensity standard forces a shift toward cleaner fuels such as electricity and
sustainable biofuels that have been independently certified to the Roundtable
on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) or equivalent standard. The standard also
discourages large, long-lived investments in high-carbon dirty fuels such as tar




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 120
sands, liquid coal, and oil shale. Moreover, a LCFS prevents emissions leakage
by evaluating the entire lifecycle of fuels.

Accurate accounting is an important requirement of any LCFS. The standard
must account for emissions that occur during fuel production nationally and
internationally. These include, for example, the effects of tar sands development
in Canada, where upstream fuel production emissions can be three times that of
conventional gasoline. The LCFS must also account for indirect land use change
emissions, which occur when U.S. land previously dedicated to food is switched
to energy crops and the displaced food is instead grown internationally by
cultivating land that previously stored vast amounts of carbon.

Equity Considerations: While its explicit focus is on carbon pollution, an
LCFS would also drive deep reductions in criteria co-pollutants that impair air
quality in the state. As with all of the policy recommendations, care should
be taken that standards have specific targets and incentives for low-income
communities, communities of color, and other pollution burdened residents.
For LCFS in particular, leaning too heavily on such a policy without careful
consideration of impacts in the 2030 timeframe could be expensive, affect
air quality differently across the state, and encourage the use of biomass
feedstocks of lower environmental standards.

RECOMMENDATION 1: ADOPT BUILDING ENERGY CODES THAT MOVE
TOWARDS ALL-ELECTRIC NEW CONSTRUCTION STATEWIDE

Relevant Agencies: AQCC with cost allocation support from the PUC

Recommendation Details: The easiest and cheapest way to abate GHG
emissions from buildings is to build clean from the start because it avoids
the costs of gas infrastructure. Buildings that are designed to run on clean
electricity from day one also avoid the need for more expensive retrofits in later
years. Based on our modeling, the standard should set a target of 55 percent of
new homes being all electric by 2025, requiring all new homes to be all electric
by 2030 or soon thereafter.

One way in which the state can begin this transformation is to adopt the
2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). The code covers
building components like insulation, lighting, and water heating efficiency,
and will represent the biggest energy efficiency gains in at least a decade for
constructing or renovating homes. The 2021 IECC also has requirements that
ensure buildings will not face unnecessary costs to transition to running on
100 percent clean electricity. New commercial buildings will also be required
to be more efficient. In later years Colorado will have to adopt statewide
requirements for all-electric new construction. The 2021 IECC will lay the
foundation for this statewide new construction code.

Equity Considerations: In many cases, it already is less expensive and faster
to build new homes with all-electric appliances. All-electric construction is
cheaper because it avoids the costs of gas infrastructure, including connecting
gas lines, installing gas meters, and piping gas into the building to run the




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 122
appliances. Avoiding all of these components can save thousands in land
development and construction costs, but intervention from the Colorado PUC
will be needed to ensure that these cost reductions flow down to low-income
Coloradoans. Also, the AQCC should work with housing developers to create
all-electric affordable housing options that incorporate energy storage and
resiliency considerations in the event of power outages.


RECOMMENDATION 2: ELIMINATE RESTRICTIONS ON FUEL-SWITCHING IN
UTILITY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS

Relevant Agencies: PUC

Recommendation Details: In Colorado, fuel switching (i.e., using an efficiency
incentive to reduce end use energy consumption by switching from one fuel
to another, such as by replacing an inefficient gas water heater with an electric
heat pump water heater that is three or more times as efficient) has arguably
been discouraged by outdated regulations. We should be gearing efficiency
programs towards GHG reduction, but these rules restrict beneficial and
strategic electrification that reduces both total energy use and greenhouse
gas emissions. In order to resolve any uncertainty, the PUC must revisit and
redesign fuel switching rules to clearly allow and encourage state electrification
of end uses today served by combusting fossil fuels.

Specifically, PUC Rule 4756(b) states:

“Fuel switching. Fuel switching from natural gas to other fossil fuel derived
energy sources shall not be included in the gas utility’s DSM program. Programs
to save natural gas through switching to renewable energy sources such as
solar heating and ground source heat pumps are allowed.”

Some have interpreted these rules as disallowing fuel switching from natural
gas to electricity because electricity is still in part a “fossil fuel derived energy
source.” It would be prudent for the PUC to revisit this rule and explicitly allow
for electrification as a form of gas DSM.

Equity Considerations: The state should be helping Coloradans moving away
from fossil fuels, not creating barriers. Additionally, the more difficult it is to
switch from fossil fuel appliances, the slower the adoption will be for low-
income customers and the higher the likelihood that low-income customers are
stuck paying off the costs of the gas distribution infrastructure.




                       COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 123
RECOMMENDATION 3: MAXIMIZE BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMS

Relevant Agencies: PUC, AQCC, Utilities

Recommendation Details: The PUC must work with the AQCC to open a docket
ensuring building electrification and decarbonization programs are maximized
and policies, procedures, and incentives that accelerate the reduction of GHG
emissions from buildings are developed. Programs and policies should advance
the state’s market for low-emission space and water heating technologies
by educating consumers, training contractors and vendors, and developing
upstream and midstream market programs.

Utilities play a crucial role in developing and carrying out electrification
programs as well. They must provide programs and incentives for homes and
businesses to shift their space and water heating to super-efficient electric
heat pumps and cooking from burning fossil fuels to clean electricity. Where
appropriate, programs should incentivize the high efficiency “cold climate” heat
pump models that are able to efficiently address heating needs during much
more of the Colorado winter than standard air source heat pump products.

As part of the docket, the AQCC and PUC can align customer-facing programs
with state energy and environmental policy goals to accelerate the reduction
of GHG emissions, improve experiences with utility programs, and create a
framework that will inform and improve future programs’ alignment with the
state’s climate targets. In addition to decarbonization strategies, the PUC
and AQCC should work together to include an integrated process for long-
term planning for gas demand projection, infrastructure maintenance, and the
transition to a more limited fossil fuel delivery system.

Equity Considerations: It is critical that incentives and financing mechanisms
are carved out for low- and moderate-income residents in electrification
programs. As gas demand drops, those who are least able to electrify on their
own risk being left to cover the escalating costs of a gas system in transition.
Protecting Colorado’s low-income families will require an approach that is
inclusive, equitable, and specifically targets communities that have historically
been unable to access energy programs. New policy development, program
design, and implementation must all ensure that disadvantaged communities
provide input and can access the benefits of decarbonization and that no
households are left behind to pay for stranded fossil fuel infrastructure.

The state and workers in this sector will also benefit from a process that takes
particular care in the inclusion of workforce development considerations
and resources that provide technical assistance along the way. A statewide
assessment of existing gas infrastructure, options for infrastructure contraction
and other cost reductions, identification of customers that have limited options
for electrification, and discussion and planning for a just transition for the




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 124
gas delivery system workforce will all help put policy makers, utilities, and
customers on the best path to transform the system.

RECOMMENDATION 4: ADOPT AN EXISTING BUILDING PERFORMANCE
STANDARD

Relevant Agencies: AQCC

Recommendation Details: A Building Performance Standard (BPS) is a long-
term policy that requires certain buildings to meet minimum energy or carbon
efficiency requirements by a given date. The central component of an existing
building performance standard for Colorado should be an absolute emissions
budget. Our modeling shows that emissions should not exceed 11.7 MMT CO2
in 2025, and 10.5 MMT CO2 in 2030. Based on these goals, AQCC staff should
develop mid- and long-term performance requirements appropriate for
both residential and commercial buildings and require the adoption of LEED
platinum standards or other comparable standards for all existing and new
construction of government buildings. Additionally, the AQCC could use Avert
or EPA’s eGRID data to develop suitable conversions which would need to be
done on an ongoing basis with the changing grid.

As part of any existing building performance standard, the state should also
adopt tools that can help support transitioning away from fossil fuels in existing
buildings, such as energy auditing and disclosure requirements that make it
easier to understand, verify, and improve a building’s carbon footprint, and new
incentives to promote electric equipment. The supporting policies should be
made available to building owners well in advance of performance deadlines.

Equity Considerations: A building performance standard is an opportunity to
decarbonize existing buildings in a way that lifts up communities and avoids
unintended consequences on the availability and affordability of local housing.
The AQCC should actively engage community stakeholders in planning and
implementing building electrification programs so they do not unintentionally
harm vulnerable populations. At a minimum, decarbonization policies should be
paired with affordable housing preservation and anti-displacement provisions.
Those provisions should be shaped by community input, and they should
ensure that investments to electrify affordable buildings (deed-restricted or
naturally occurring affordable housing) will not result in evictions or residents’
inability to cover their living expenses.

Targeted pilots and research should be conducted as part of the rulemaking
to better evaluate decarbonization opportunities in multifamily buildings,
particularly affordable multifamily housing. There are many examples of all-
electric low- and high-rise multi-family buildings that can serve as models for
new construction and retrofit projects, but building the capacity to install and
operate these solutions will require concerted programmatic effort. Again, it will




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 125
be important to coordinate with communities and ensure that decarbonization
policies are paired with affordable housing preservation policies, including anti-
displacement provisions.

In the absence of support, high upfront capital costs will prevent low-income
customers from being early adopters of decarbonization. Without the explicit
prioritization of low-income and vulnerable communities, these customers
run the risk of being stranded on a gas system with increasing costs. For that
reason alone, equity must be a leading value in the efforts to decarbonize
Colorado’s buildings.



OIL & GAS METHANE RECOMMENDATIONS

    •	 Policies for achieving the 2025 statewide goal of a 26 percent reduction
       in GHGs
             Percentage reduction in 2005 emissions needed by 2025 in Core Case:
             n/a14
             Absolute CO2 emission budget for 2025 in Core Case: 15.8 MMT CO2e

    •	 Policies for achieving the 2030 statewide goal of a 50 percent reduction
       in GHGs
             Percentage reduction in 2005 emissions needed by 2030 in Core Case:
             54 percent
             Absolute CO2 emission budget for 2030 in Core Case: 9.2 MMT CO2e

As with all other sectors, there are three components to successfully limiting
emissions from the oil and gas sector: (1) setting an emission budget for the
sector consistent with achieving the 2025 and 2030 goals in HB-1261; (2)
setting performance standards to try to meet the emission budget (e.g., targets
for emission rates, requirements to use the most effective emission reduction
technology, etc.); and (3) establishing other mechanisms for reducing emissions
if the performance standards are insufficient to keep total emissions at or below
the emissions budget for the entire sector.


RECOMMENDATION 1: ADOPT A MASS-BASED METHANE EMISSION LIMIT
FOR THE ENTIRE OIL & GAS SECTOR IN COLORADO

Relevant Agencies: AQCC

Recommendation Details: SB 19-181 authorizes the OGCC to set various
standards for oil and gas production, such as monitoring and reporting of
methane leaks, targets for methane leakage rates, technology requirements,
etc. These standards are critical, as discussed below in Recommendation 2.
14	 Given the substantial increase in oil and gas development between 2005 and the present, and the resulting increase in GHG
emissions, our modeling shows there is still an increase in oil and gas emissions between 2005 and 2025.




                                   COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 126
However, these kinds of standards cannot, by themselves, guarantee that total
methane emissions from the oil and gas sector stay below the level needed
for the state to meet the 2025 and 2030 targets in HB-1261. Limits on the
methane leakage rate, or even mass-based limits on leakage from individual
wells, leave the total amount of methane emissions subject to chance, because
total emissions are equal to the emission rates times the amount of production.
Ultimately, if production levels are high enough, even a very low methane
leakage rate can lead to total emissions that exceed the overall emissions
budget for the oil and gas sector.

Accordingly, to ensure that oil and gas emissions stay within an emission
budget that allows the state to meet the goals in HB-1261 state policymakers
must adopt a legally binding limit on total methane emissions from oil and gas
production.


RECOMMENDATION 2: ADOPT STRONG RULES TO IMPLEMENT SB 19-181

Relevant Agencies: AQCC, OGCC

Recommendation Details: SB 19-181 directs the OGCC to minimize methane
emissions from the oil and gas sector and HB 19-1261 grants the AQCC authority
to issue any rules necessary to achieve the GHG reductions in 1261. The OGCC,
the AQCC, or both agencies should adopt technical standards for methane
emissions from the oil and gas sector, including production, processing,
transportation, distribution, and storage of oil and gas. Standards for methane
leak detection and repair and inspecting, monitoring, and reporting methane
emissions are critical to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas
sector.


RECOMMENDATION 3: INCLUDE IN ALL NEW OIL & GAS PERMITS
PROVISIONS FOR REOPENING OR REVOKING THE PERMIT IF OIL & GAS
METHANE EMISSIONS EXCEED THE 2025 AND/OR 2030 EMISSION LIMITS

Relevant Agencies: AQCC, OGCC

Recommendation Details: If the standards that the OGCC issues under SB 19-
181, combined with other initiatives, result in methane emissions that exceed
15.8 MMT CO2e in 2025, oil and gas production should be limited to the level
at which the methane leakage rates multiplied by production equals 15.5 MMT
for the year 2026. The production level should then be set for each subsequent
year to put the oil and gas sector on a linear emissions trajectory to emit no
more than 9.2 MMT CO2e in 2030.

To do this, the OGCC should issue a rule as soon as possible clarifying that all
new oil and gas production permits contain provisions that allow the OGCC to
reopen and/or revoke the permit if reported or modeled methane emissions




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 127
from the oil and gas sector exceed an AQCC-specified emissions budget for
2025 and 2030. In 2025 and 2030, the AQCC would then calculate methane
emissions from the entire oil and gas sector. If the sector’s emissions exceed
the sector’s emission budget, the OGCC would reopen and redefine oil and gas
permits to reduce production to a level consistent with the sector’s emission
budget. The OGCC would do this through setting production limits in permits
and/or by revoking permits.

In addition, when deciding whether to issue a new permit, the OGCC should
analyze whether the expected methane emissions from the new permit are
consistent with the overall methane emission budget for the oil and gas sector
for 2025 through 2030. The OGCC should not issue new permits if the analysis
shows that the permit would be expected to cause the industry’s overall
methane emissions to exceed the industry’s methane emissions budget for any
year.

Equity Considerations: Significant funding for inspections and enforcement
should be set aside and setbacks should be established that protect schools
and homes, particularly in low-income communities and communitiea of color.


RECOMMENDATION 4: CUT OVERALL OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION BY 25
PERCENT BY 2030 RELATIVE TO 2019 PRODUCTION LEVELS

Relevant Agencies: AQCC, OGCC

Recommendation Details: As discussed earlier, the total methane emissions
could potentially still be high even with ambitious leakage rates, if production
grows. Therefore, without some ability to control the overall amount of oil
and gas production, it will be impossible for the state to ensure that oil and
gas methane emissions are at a level consistent with the goals in HB-1261. This
issue is one of the reasons we recommend that the AQCC and/or OGCC create
a mechanism for reducing oil and gas production—particularly to address a
situation in which total methane emissions from oil and gas production exceed
the sector’s methane emission budget.

Colorado’s policies for energy supply should match its policies on energy
demand. Both the Roadmap and our analysis show that demand for oil and
gas must decline significantly between 2020 and 2030 and decline even more
between 2030 and 2050 to meet the HB-1261 targets. In the electric sector,
power plants must burn less gas; in the transportation sector, vehicles must
burn less gasoline and diesel; in the buildings sector, Coloradans must use less
gas for heating and cooking; and industry must burn less gas and petroleum-
based fuels as well.

In our modeling, in the Core scenario, demand for oil and gas declines 30




                      COMMITTING TO CLIMATE ACTION | 128
percent by 2030 relative to 2019 (and declines by 40 percent in the Slow
Electricity case). Thus, the 25 percent decline in oil and gas production is in line
with the decrease in demand that our modeling shows is necessary to meet the
state’s climate targets.

It is fundamentally incompatible to say, on one hand, that decarbonization
requires the state to use less oil and gas by 2030, but on the other hand say
that the state should be permitted to produce more oil and gas by 2030. Given
that Colorado must reduce demand for oil and gas to meet its climate targets,
an increase in oil and gas production in Colorado necessarily means that state
policymakers are assuming that other state(s) and/or countries will increase
their use of oil and gas. This is a self-defeating climate policy because Colorado
can succeed in preventing additional climate change only if other states and
countries adopt policies similar to Colorado’s. Thus, any comprehensive and
effective climate policy cannot be based on Colorado increasing oil and gas
production between 2020 and 2030 at the same time that Colorado must
reduce oil and gas use by 2030.

For these reasons, the AQCC and OGCC should adopt rules to reduce overall
oil and gas output 25 percent by 2030 relative to 2019 production levels. These
rules should entail granting only an amount of new permits that is consistent
with this overall production limit, and/or restricting the length of the permit
and/or the amount of production allowed under the permit.

Equity Considerations: With reductions in methane and oil and gas production
will come workforce implications that the state must prepare for. These
industries have been providing jobs, economic benefits, and funding at the
state and local level. State policymakers must develop detailed plans, informed
by engagement with communities from the start and supported by the state
budget, to ensure a just and equitable transition. If the state assumes that the
industry will grow, and it turns out that it economically declines, the economic
impacts will be worse than if the state actively plans for a transition and
supports communities with economic investment, revenue replacement for
local governments, and job training, healthcare, and other support for workers.

RECOMMENDATION 1: ADOPT A RULE TO REQUIRE ZERO-EMISSION
TECHNOLOGIES FOR EQUIPMENT USED IN OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION

Relevant Agencies: AQCC

Recommendation Details: Upstream GHG emissions from the oil and gas
sector include not just the methane emissions discussed previously but also
CO2 emissions from burning gas in equipment used to produce, process, and
transport oil and gas. The AQCC should adopt a rule requiring the use of
zero-emissions technologies for certain gas-fired equipment used in oil and
gas operations, including engines, controllers, compressors, and pumps. This
rule should set a zero-emission standard for all lean burn engines and all rich
burn engines with greater than 100 horsepower. The AQCC could allow for
exemptions from this requirement in limited circumstances where electrification
may be infeasible, particularly locations in which it would be prohibitively
expensive to access the electric grid. Several studies, including analyses from
the California Air Resources Board and Southwest Energy Efficiency Project,
have concluded that electric engines cost less for both capital and fuel costs
than gas-power engines, for certain sizes and classes of engines (particularly
smaller engines). Thus, in many instances, electrifying the engines used in oil
and gas operations can actually save operators money compared to the use of
gas-fired engines.




15	 Given the substantial increase in oil and gas development between 2005 and the present and the resulting increase in industrial
energy use, industrial CO2 emissions do not decline below 2005 levels by 2025 or 2030 even with the substantial reductions from
today’s emissions levels.

RECOMMENDATION 2: ENACT A “BUY CLEAN” PROVISION TO INCENTIVIZE
PUBLICLY PURCHASED INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS TO BE INCREASINGLY LOW
EMISSIONS

Relevant Agencies: AQCC, legislature

Recommendation Details: Colorado has a diverse manufacturing sector that
produces metals, cement and concrete products, glass, chemicals, plastics
and rubber, and other products. The state must reduce emissions from these
manufacturing sectors through electrification, efficiency, and use of low-
carbon fuels to meet its climate goals. Through a mix of transparency and
disclosure requirements, standards, and incentives, a Buy Clean rule can help
policymakers leverage state and local government procurement to encourage
manufacturing facilities to develop lower emissions practices. Such a policy
should require companies to track and report the embodied carbon emissions
of their products (the emissions released in producing and transporting the
product) via an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)—or comparable
mechanisms subject to high standards of consistency and verification—when
bidding for publicly funded projects (e.g., expansion or renovation of public
transit); establish a requirement for procured products to meet minimum CO2
emissions performance standards that decline over time; and provide financial
incentives to help instate facilities retool and offer products with lower CO2
emissions intensity to meet those standards. Colorado should also incentivize
more ambitious reductions in emissions intensity above the minimum threshold
by applying discount rates to qualifying bids from instate producers that use
the lowest carbon ingredients and processes. The rule should apply to energy-
intensive products that are commonly procured, including but not limited to
iron, steel, and concrete.
