ENHANCING NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS:
8 simple recommendations for integrating nature into NDCs


INTRODUCTION
The concept of nature-based solutions (NbS) has gained momentum in several international
fora, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the World
Economic Forum, and the UN General Assembly, among others. While nature-based
solutions can be deployed to address a number of societal challenges, they have
emerged as essential tools to both adapt to and mitigate climate change.

                                                                                                                In 2020 Parties to the UNFCCC

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTEGRATING
NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR CLIMATE IN
REVISED NDCS
                 1
                        Include the use of nature for both climate change mitigation and adaptation and prioritize actions that
                        provide benefits for both.


                 2
                        Set ambitious, measurable and time-bound numeric targets (e.g. hectares of ecosystems utilized, CO2
                        sequestered and/or number of people benefiting from increased resilience).



                 3
                        To maximize benefits to biodiversity, utilize natural ecosystems over “artificial” or “modified”
                        ecosystems, and include climate benefits derived from protected areas.


                 4      Explore all ecosystem types that can provide climate benefits – wetlands, forests, mangroves, coral
                        reefs, grasslands, working lands, urban landscapes.


                 5      Acknowledge and manage climate risks that threaten the long-term viability of nature-based solutions.



                 6
                        Integrate commitments to other international conventions and relevant national policies that result in
                        climate adaptation and mitigation benefits.


                 7      Ensure adherence to social and environmental safeguards, and include community participation and
                        consultation in the development and management of nature-based climate solutions.


                 8      Include the need for technical and financial support to achieve results.

                              CO-BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE AND NATURE
This graphic depicts a simple way to think about the use of nature to deliver measurable climate change adaptation and mitigation outcomes while delivering
co-benefits for biodiversity and human wellbeing. Examples are illustrative and not meant to be comprehensive.




This interpretation of nature-based solutions can provide
clarity to Parties to the UNFCCC in several areas. First,
both climate change adaptation and mitigation outcomes
are included and are of equal importance. The intentional
focus on designing for climate change outcomes, rather
than incidental mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of
conservation activities is critical for increasing climate
ambition. Measurable outcomes enable countries to monitor
progress against targets and are essential to access climate
finance. Considering and optimizing benefits for people and
nature creates synergies with other international conventions
such as the Sustainable Development Goals, Convention on
Biological Diversity, and Sendai Framework, and ensures
adherence to social and environmental safeguards. Finally,
as the long-term viability of nature-based solutions is
compromised by climate change threats to nature itself, it is
essential that interventions acknowledge and manage climate
risks to help increase their resilience and long-term viability.
