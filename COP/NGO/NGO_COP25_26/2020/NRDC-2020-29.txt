Introduction
While the international community has struggled to curtail greenhouse gas
emissions, forests around the world have been buying us time to transition to
clean, renewable-energy economies. Forests act as giant carbon vaults, storing
away in their wood, leaves, and soil more carbon than is found in all currently
accessible coal, oil, and gas reserves combined.1
 Forests also continuously add
to this carbon vault and in recent decades have absorbed nearly one-third of the
greenhouse gases we release each year.2 The global scientific community has made
it clear we must limit warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (C) in order to
avoid the worst impacts of climate change,3
 and that doing so will require not just
ending our reliance on fossil fuels, but also protecting intact and primary forests’
ability to store and absorb carbon.4
The Canadian boreal forest, which comprises a quarter
of the world’s remaining intact forestland5
 and is part
of the most carbon-dense forest biome on the planet,6
 is
particularly key to achieving a 1.5 °C pathway. In its soils
and vegetation, the Canadian boreal stores twice as much
carbon as the world’s oil reserves.7
 It is central to global
carbon regulation,8
 making its protection and management
a matter of global importance. Yet each year, industrial
logging erodes the Canadian boreal’s value for the climate,
cutting down more than 400,000 hectares of the forest9
 to
turn it into toilet paper, newsprint, lumber, and biofuels.10
To put this in perspective, Canada falls just behind Brazil
and Russia in terms of annual intact forest landscape loss,
even when losses caused by wildfires are removed11—with
60 percent of this loss occurring in areas leased by logging
companies.12 More than 90 percent of this logging is in
the form of clearcutting,13 a practice in which the logging
operation removes nearly all the trees from a given area.14
Industrial logging practices are undermining the boreal
forest’s value for the climate and resulting in significant
annual emissions.15 When this forest is logged, it releases
stored carbon from its vegetation and soils, and until it
regenerates, it loses its capacity to continue absorbing
the amount of carbon it held prior to being cut, creating
a carbon deficit.16 Thus, just like building a new polluting
factory or drilling a new oil or gas well, industrial logging in
the boreal has long-term climate impacts.17
Nevertheless, the Canadian logging industry has
consistently downplayed its impact on the global climate,
as well as on species that live in the boreal. The industry
and its representatives are overselling the forest’s capacity
to regenerate, misrepresenting forest carbon dynamics,
and omitting critical portions of its life-cycle analysis in
order to present a narrative of climate sustainability18 that
science is increasingly refuting.19
Unlike fossil fuel industries that must be phased out over
the course of a few decades, a sustainable forest industry
can align with keeping warming below 1.5 °C. However,
given its current rate, intensity, and extent, today’s
industrial logging is incompatible with a goal of maximizing
the boreal forest’s critical role in carbon storage and
threatens long-term, global climate repercussion.20
The Canadian federal government has signaled an
eagerness to become a leader in tackling land-based carbon
emissions, including taking advantage of the boreal’s unique
characteristics and benefits through nature-based climate
solutions,21 which use the value of natural ecosystems to
address climate change.22 As a flagship part of this effort,
the federal government committed to planting two billion
net additional trees over 10 years as a means of meeting
global emissions targets.23 Additionally, the federal
government has pledged to protect 30 percent of Canada’s
lands by 2030.24 These are meaningful and encouraging
measures that position Canada to lead on nature-based
climate solutions and have an additional benefit of
addressing global species collapse.
However, the government has left significant policy gaps
around mitigating the logging industry’s emissions and
protecting intact forests—both crucial to achieving its
climate targets. These loopholes bolster the logging

industry’s false narratives around its own sustainability
and undermine actions essential to safeguarding the
boreal’s role as a climate solution. Ultimately, there are two
steps the federal government will need to take to address
the impacts of logging and ensure that the boreal’s climate
value is preserved.
First, the Canadian government needs to adjust the way
it calculates and reports its forest sector emissions each
year to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), so that the reports accurately reflect net
emissions from forests. Canada, in its carbon model, has
not accounted for the fact that, contrary to industry claims,
large areas fail to reforest following logging.25 The model
also does not consider critical soil carbon dynamics that
may significantly increase logging’s climate impact.26 At a
higher level, under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change’s (IPCC) accounting methodology, Canada is able to
present its managed forests as a net carbon sink, burying
the impact of logging, which is a net source of emissions,
within its broader calculation of the entire managed forest’s
carbon sequestration capacity.27 Because the resulting
portrait of Canada’s forests is still that of a carbon sink,
it significantly downplays the logging industry’s carbon
impacts,28 allowing the industry to continue its current
practices and even contributing to its claims that industrial
logging is climate friendly.29
Second, the Canadian government needs to regulate
the logging industry’s greenhouse gas emissions. Doing
this could serve as a powerful incentive for the industry
to adopt climate-friendlier practices and motivate the
protection of intact forests. Canada’s national carbon tax,
the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, is a critical
step in regulating and reining in the fossil fuel industry’s
emissions, but the absence of a similar measure for the
logging industry leaves a vast carbon source unmitigated.
Canada’s commitments concerning protected areas and
nature-based climate solutions are promising indicators of
the federal government’s intentions, and the nation is well
placed to reform current industrial forestry practices to
be consistent with needed climate action and biodiversity
protection. However, to fully lead, Canada must protect the
climate value of its intact forests and adequately account
for and regulate logging’s carbon emissions. Doing so
will not only benefit the climate but also protect unique
and treasured species and ecosystems. Failing to update
accounting methods and properly regulate the logging
industry will make it difficult to secure a livable planet for
future generations. 

The Canadian Boreal Forest’s Global Climate Importance
The boreal is the most carbon-dense forest biome on earth,
storing twice as much per acre as tropical forests.33 The
Canadian boreal alone holds nearly twice as much carbon
than exists in all the world’s recoverable oil reserves.34
This extraordinary storage capacity stems largely from
the boreal’s short summers and acidic soils.35 Because
the boreal is so cold for much of the year, dead biomass
decays very slowly, trapping the carbon that is normally
emitted through decomposition.36 The coniferous forest’s
acidic soils also inhibit decomposition.37 In contrast to the
Amazon, which stores most of its carbon in vegetation,
more than 80 percent of the carbon in the boreal is found
within its layers of soil.38 Some of this soil carbon has been
locked up for thousands of years.39
The Canadian boreal forest stretches across North
America, from the eastern shores of Newfoundland and
Labrador to the rocky cliffs and mountains of the Yukon
Territory.30 This green crown across North America is
home to more than 600 Indigenous communities, all of
whom have relied on the land for millennia.31 It is also
habitat for cherished species such as the boreal woodland
caribou, Canada lynx, and pine marten and is the nesting
ground for billions of migratory songbirds that traverse
the skies across the Western hemisphere.32 However, the
boreal forest’s beauty and wildlife are only part of the
region’s richness. There is another, invisible layer to the
boreal’s wealth, found in its carbon-dense soils, trees,
mosses, and peat bogs. 
INTACT AND PRIMARY FORESTS
Not all forests are created equal, and intact and primary forests, terms that are used interchangeably in this paper to mean forests that are free
of any significant human footprint,40 have far greater biodiversity and climate value than forests that have been degraded by industry.41 These
forests develop over a long period, as species of plants, animals, and fungi interact and form complex relationships across decades and even
centuries.42 (The term “old growth” forest, sometimes used to refer to primary and intact forests, has no standard definition and is therefore not
used in this paper.)
Protecting intact and primary forests, especially under the leadership of Indigenous Peoples, is essential to combating climate change43 and
is, in fact, one of the cheapest and most technologically feasible climate solutions.44 These forests contain a diversity of species and habitats
that is missing in areas that have been logged or impacted by other industries such as mining and oil and gas.45 They also typically store more
carbon than their degraded counterparts,46 and they can be more resilient to natural disturbances like fires,47 which is increasingly important
as climate impacts worsen. 

Industrial Logging’s Climate Impact
BOREAL CARIBOU
Boreal caribou, the iconic species emblazoned on Canada’s quarter, have been federally listed as “threatened” since 200353 and are declining
across Canada at a rate of 30 percent every 18 years.54 Boreal caribou depend on intact forests for their survival,55 and human-caused habitat
disturbance, principally due to industrial logging, is their primary threat.56 Today only 15 of Canada’s 51 boreal caribou herds are self-sustaining
for the long term given the level of disturbance to their habitat.57 Further, caribou are an indicator species, meaning that a population’s decline
signals broader concerns in the forest ecosystem.58 The condition of this species is thus a proxy not only for the forest’s climate value59 but
also for logging’s impact on other species.60

Industrial development has taken a large toll on Canada’s
boreal forest over the past century.48 Though logging
rates have declined somewhat in the past two decades, the
logging industry nonetheless logged more than 11 million
hectares of boreal forest between 1996 and 2015,49 an area
more than twice the size of Nova Scotia. Today the logging
industry fells an area the size of seven NHL hockey rinks
every minute.50 Over the past several decades, loss of
forest habitat from logging has led to a decline in wildlife
populations such as the boreal caribou.51 In addition, while
some Indigenous communities directly benefit from and
support logging operations, many others oppose the rate
and scale of industrial logging in their territories, which is
threatening forests central to their ways of life.52
Industrial logging also has an unseen global impact on the
climate.61 NRDC conservatively estimates, using optimistic
industry assumptions about how forests recover after being
logged, that the current rate of logging in the Canadian
boreal forest releases 26 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide per year (not including emissions from products
removed from the forest), which is equivalent to the annual
emissions of 5.5 million cars.62 This is due to the fact that,
while trees regrow, logging reduces the forest’s capability
to continue absorbing carbon. At the same time, soil
disturbance, decaying logging litter, and increased plant
respiration flood the atmosphere with carbon that had
previously been locked up in the boreal ecosystem.63 The
rate of forest regeneration across the boreal cannot keep
up with the amount of carbon that harvesting releases each
year, resulting in a significant climate impact.

The potential effect of logging on boreal soils is particularly
concerning. Because of the carbon density of boreal
soils, releasing even a small proportion of this carbon
can have a significant climate impact. While the full
relationship between logging and soil carbon is still being
studied, clearcutting can affect soils through changes
in temperature and sunlight, compaction, and other
physical disturbances.65 As a result, the vast amounts of
organic material stored there become more susceptible to
decomposition, potentially converting carbon that had once
been safely trapped within the boreal soil into atmospheric
carbon dioxide.66 One meta-analysis of soil carbon losses
catalogued around the world found an average loss of 11.2%
of carbon from the soils after logging.67 Logging’s impact on
the carbon stored in deeper soil layers is more uncertain,
but potentially significant.68
Clearcutting intact boreal forests also reduces the forest’s
capability to continue absorbing carbon while the trees
regrow. Ultimately, the net effect of clearcutting over time
is to create a landscape with more young trees and fewer
older ones, pushing tree age and therefore carbon stores
to a lower baseline.69 The shorter the harvest rotation (the
number of years between logging operations in the same
area), the lower this baseline. While there is some evidence
that younger trees do absorb carbon at a faster rate than
older ones,70 replacing an older and larger forest with a
younger stand creates a long-term carbon debt.71 Older
forests already hold massive amounts of carbon, and they
and the soils around them continue to absorb carbon as
they age.72 Not only does it take decades for a new tree to
reach the size of the felled one and absorb the amount of
carbon that the felled one previously held, but during that
time the now-felled tree would have continued to sequester
carbon.73
LOGGING SCARS: DEFORESTATION’S SIGNIFICANT,
BUT HIDDEN, LEGACY
Unfortunately, current carbon emissions estimates, while
troubling, may not even tell the whole story. They likely
downplay logging’s full climate impact because they assume
complete forest recovery, in alignment with industry and
provincial government claims that the forest grows back
entirely after it has been cut (i.e., for every tree that is cut
down, another tree regrows).74 Under this assumption,
eventually the forest will regain the carbon sequestration
capacity and biodiversity functions it had prior to being
clearcut, and this, the logging industry claims, makes
it inherently sustainable.75 And because the forest is
not converted to another use, such as farmland or city
development, Canada does not classify the logging that
is occurring as “deforestation,” instead designating it as
“degradation.”76
However, in addition to the fact that, as discussed below,
second-growth forests tend to lack the same ecosystem
services and health of primary forests,77 a study of more
than two dozen logged forest sites in northwestern
Ontario found that more than 14 percent of the logged area
was essentially barren 20 to 30 years after the logging
occurred.78 Nor was there evidence from those sites that
trees would become reforested by the time re-logging
of the site is planned.79 These long-term scars are due
to the creation of logging roads and “landings,” where
logs and unwanted logging residue are processed with
heavy equipment and stacked, compacting the earth and
suppressing regrowth.80 While that research covered only
one region of Ontario, the full-tree logging practice that
led to this deforestation, in which the entire logged tree
is dragged to the roadside, is the dominant approach in
Ontario and accounts for about 50 percent of logging in
Quebec.81 It is also used in British Columbia, Alberta, and
the prairie provinces.82 Thus, it is likely that these scars
exist in clearcuts throughout much of the Canadian boreal.
As a result, while Canada claims that it has nearly zero
deforestation—and proudly holds itself up in contrast to
countries like Brazil and Indonesia—the truth is that a
significant portion of forest is not regrowing. If the results
from the 27 clearcuts studied are indicative of conditions
across all of Ontario (which should itself be a research
priority), uncounted logging infrastructure in this province
alone would increase Canada’s reported deforestation rate
by 700 percent.
In addition to harming wildlife, these essentially barren
areas have a significant carbon impact. Because they

remain stripped of productive forest cover, they remain
in a significant carbon deficit.83 Yet, because provinces
have not reported these deforested areas in their forest
surveys, these deficits are undocumented in Canada’s
annual accounting, meaning the logging industry’s climate
impact is understated. By 2030, assuming the current rate
of deforestation continues, these logging scars plus 11 years
of additional ones in Ontario will have reduced the forest’s
climate mitigation potential by a total of 41 million metric
tons of CO2, equivalent to more than a year of emissions
from Canada’s passenger vehicles.84
THE REDUCED VALUE OF SECOND-GROWTH
FORESTS
Even where trees do return, there is evidence that these
second-growth forests do not provide the same ecosystem
services or have the ecological health of the original
forest.85 This is exacerbated by the logging industry’s
practice of replanting fewer species of commercially
valuable trees that are all of a uniform age.86 This
“logging-centric” practice creates a regrown forest that
is intentionally less biologically and structurally diverse
than it was prior to logging.87 Even under ideal natural
regeneration conditions, however, it can take well over a
century for a forest to achieve its original structural and
biological diversity,88 along with its original carbon storage
and sequestration potential.89
The degradation of intact forests also has an often
overlooked impact on the ecosystem’s overall resilience.
Intact forests are more resistant to natural disturbances
and more adaptable to climate change than are previously
logged, second-growth areas.90 Though there is a range
of predictions for how forests will respond to a warming
climate, studies have shown that industrial logging can
exacerbate fire risk and increase fire intensity.91 Previously
clearcut forests are also often more susceptible to harmful
invasive species, especially insect infestations.92 As a
forest loses its ability to fend off or recover from these
disturbances, it will experience even greater carbon loss. 

WILDFIRE
Wildfires have been integral to the boreal forest’s ecological health since time immemorial. As wildfires become more frequent and more
extreme, industry often claims that logging thins the forest and prevents wildfires from raging out of control. However, this argument deflects
attention from logging's overall ecological impacts and omits the fact that, in the face of wildfires, protecting intact forests only becomes more
urgent.93
While some forestry activities can be helpful in reducing the frequency of fires,94 intensive logging practices like clearcutting and secondgrowth forests are often associated with more frequent and intense blazes.95 In addition, in terms of ecological disturbance, fires are not
biologically, chemically, or structurally equivalent to clearcut logging.96 Typical wildfires burn off less than a quarter of the total biomass, and
much of the resulting dead wood continues to store carbon97 or is converted to charcoal, which has an average age in the soil of 600 to 2,000
years.98 By contrast, clearcut logging removes almost all of a region’s trees for conversion into products with far shorter life spans.
Furthermore, the climate-caused increase in fires is not occurring uniformly across Canada, meaning that an argument that logging will reduce
wildfires would be irrelevant in some areas. This is especially true in the eastern boreal forest, which has avoided the large-scale fires that
dominated the summer and fall news cycles in Canada in recent years.99 Models forecasting climate change impacts show that this trend will
continue, with eastern forests far less impacted by fires than western ones.100 This further drives the need to protect intact forests—especially
in the east, where a significant percentage of boreal logging occurs—as critical bastions for carbon and biodiversity in a changing climate.


HOW CLEARCUTTING THE BOREAL RELEASES
CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
1. An intact boreal forest has vast stores of
carbon locked away—more than 80% of which
is found in its soils.iv Even older trees continue to sequester carbon as they age. When
a tree dies, it slowly releases some of this
carbon over time, but much of the carbon—up
to 90% even after a fire— ends up back in
the ecosystem.
2. Logging leaves woody debris and
disturbs the carbon-rich soil, emitting
carbon into the atmosphere.vii
Clearcutting also dramatically reduces
the landscape’s capacity to sequester
carbon, resulting in a carbon debt.
3. The clearcut forest continues to emit
carbon from the soils and logging debris.
As trees regrow, they begin absorbing carbon, but the forest remains at a significant
carbon deficit from where it was before.
Furthermore, recent studies have shown
that significant areas of clearcut stands
remain barren even decades later, further
exacerbating climate impacts. 

4. After the wood is cut and manufactured into a long-lived
Harvested Wood Product (HWP), it retains only a fraction of its
original carbon—as little as 15 percent.ix However, much of the
wood from Canada is instead turned into paper or throwaway
tissue products, which are even less effective at retaining
carbon. When the wood is burned for biofuel, all its carbon is
emitted.x As an HWP ages, it continues to emit its remaining
carbon.xi When it is discarded in a landfill, it begins emitting
both carbon and methane.xii 
Shortfalls in Canada’s Climate Policies
The Canadian government has made strong and
unprecedented commitments to nature-based climate
solutions. As part of this shift, it is pursuing the protection
of 30 percent of its terrestrial areas by 2030101 and a
commitment under the Pan-Canadian Framework on
Clean Growth and Climate Change to “protect[] and
enhanc[e] carbon sinks including in forests, wetlands
and agricultural lands.”102 These actions are a critical and
positive development for both the global climate and the
species that rely on intact boreal forests, and they signal
the federal government’s understanding of the boreal
forest’s key role in addressing the climate crisis. However,
by failing to adequately account for and regulate the logging
industry’s carbon emissions, Canada is not creating the
proper incentives for provinces and industry to meet these
goals. Instead it is leaving the management of a significant
carbon source in the hands of industry, trusting it will
self-regulate. At the same time, policy platforms promoting
harvested wood products as a climate solution threaten
to undercut the very carbon storage goals they intend to
achieve.
CANADA’S CARBON REPORTING
Each year, Canada is required to submit a National
Inventory Report to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an account of
the country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.103 Canada
includes estimated emissions from its managed forests
under the category of Land Use, Land Use Change, and
Forestry (LULUCF).104 Canada, as allowed under IPCC
rules, relies on modeled estimates rather than direct
data.105 In doing so, it adopts a number of problematic
assumptions that downplay logging’s full climate impacts.
For example, the model does not incorporate the climate
impacts of mosses lost during logging, and the model’s
assumptions around the rates of soil carbon loss may not
account for industrial logging’s full impact on the soil.106
While the science around industrial logging’s effect on
soils is evolving, Canada has, in many cases, chosen to
adopt more conservative assumptions or simply not
incorporate these impacts. In addition, Canada’s model
relies on provinces’ assumptions about the success of
forest regeneration,107 which studies have shown are not an
accurate metric of actual forest regrowth. For instance, as
discussed above, Canada’s reporting does not capture the
climate impact of the significant logging scars found in one
study of 27 sites in Ontario,108 an exclusion that may also
apply to other parts of Ontario and other provinces.
In addition, international accounting rules allow certain
practices that distort the overall picture of land-based
carbon flows (sources and sinks). For example, Canada’s
emissions from logging are obscured because they are
buried within the net positive carbon balance achieved
overall by its managed forests. In its National Inventory
Report estimating 2018 emissions, despite clearcutting
more than 400,000 hectares of forest that year, Canada 
reported that its forests had a net removal of greenhouse
gases of 14 million metric tons CO2e (Figure 1).109 Canada is
giving itself carbon credit for the forests it doesn’t cut in its
healthiest forest areas, positioning its managed forests as a
net carbon sink, even if each year logging ultimately adds to
the carbon in the atmosphere relative to an unlogged forest.
This 14 million metric tons are now being counted toward
Canada’s 2030 emissions target, in essence helping to offset
emissions from other sectors, even while climate-critical
intact forests are being lost.110 Meanwhile, Canada does
not include impacts from natural disturbances like fires
and insects in this carbon calculation,111 which, especially
given the increase in these disturbances in many parts of
the boreal forest, oversells the ability of the remaining
unlogged forests to offset emissions (Figure 1).
FOREST CARBON REGULATIONS
The lack of adequate regulation of emissions from the
forestry sector means the industry is offloading the social
and economic cost of its sizable climate impact onto the
rest of the world. Canada recently took significant steps
to begin using market forces to regulate its greenhouse
gas emissions, passing a national carbon tax in October
2018.112 This Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act set the
initial price of carbon at C$20 per ton in 2019 and will
increase it to C$50 per ton by 2022, with revenue going
mostly to provide rebates to Canadian citizens.113 However,
this carbon price does not apply to emissions from forest
harvesting, leaving a significant gap in the emissions being
regulated and ignoring a potentially meaningful source
of revenue that could be used to help transition to a clean
energy economy.
The absence of a carbon price on logging industry
emissions also means that there are no direct financial
incentives in place to drive climate-friendlier forestry or
the protection of carbon-rich intact forests. While the
federal government has discussed incentivizing forest
protection through the sale of carbon offsets,114 which allow
a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in one area to
compensate for emissions made elsewhere, offsets alone
will not be enough to meet international climate goals. This
is because offsets treat reductions in forestry emissions
as a replacement for decarbonization efforts when, in
fact, Canada needs to both achieve a decarbonized energy
economy and maximize the carbon storage in its forests.
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HARVESTED WOOD
PRODUCTS
A pervasive and misguided narrative, based on selective
science and misleading assumptions, has made its way
into federal and provincial policy in Canada. According
to this narrative, logging is unreservedly good for climate
mitigation, in large part because of the carbon benefits of
durable harvested wood products (HWPs).115 For example,
the Quebec government recently announced that, because
HWPs like lumber and finished wooden furniture continue
to store carbon while the forest regrows from logging,
increasing the potential stored carbon, the province would
be expanding industrial logging as a climate solution.116
Similarly, the Ontario government has stated that “when
carbon stored in harvested wood products is factored into
carbon accounting, sustainably managed forests are always
a carbon sink.”117
This narrative is also embedded in Canada’s “Mid-Century
Long-Term Low-Greenhouse Gas Development Strategy,”
which outlines policy pathways for reducing the country’s
greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050.118 This
document highlights HWPs as one emissions-reducing
justification for continued intensive logging.119 Canada’s
“Pan-Canadian Climate Framework,” which outlines
national and subnational policies to reduce Canada’s
greenhouse gas emissions, similarly emphasizes the role
of industrial logging and HWPs in carbon storage and
achieving its promised emissions reduction targets.120
However, these policies ignore an important caveat that
appears throughout the scientific literature: HWPs provide
a climate benefit only under very strict conditions, and
these conditions are rarely grounded in real-world logging
practices.121 When forest products’ complete life-cycle
analysis, from cradle to grave, is conducted, the picture
becomes far more complicated and the climate benefits
tenuous.122
First, life-cycle analyses of HWPs often do not account for
the carbon impact of the logging itself, instead assuming
carbon neutrality in the logging process and perfect forest
regeneration.123 The IPCC states that HWPs can provide
carbon storage benefits if their wood is harvested “equal
to or below” the natural forest regrowth rate.124 When
this condition is not met, HWPs become a climate liability.
In fact, according to a recent study, when making more
reasonable assumptions about logging practices, HWPs end
up having an even greater carbon impact than concrete.125
In addition, by the time a tree is logged, processed,
and manufactured into a finished product, it has lost a
significant amount of its stored carbon. Some studies have
shown that as much as 40 percent of the tree’s carbon
remains in the biomass left as waste to decompose on the
forest floor or burned for fuel.126 Only about 20 percent of
the tree’s original carbon ultimately remains in the finished
long-lived wood product.127 HWPs are also relatively
ineffective at retaining any remaining carbon in the long
term.128 After a century, the product may retain as little
as 1 percent of the tree’s original carbon.129 Meanwhile,
as allowed under IPCC rules, Canada does not actually
count these inevitable emissions from HWPs at the time
of logging, instead waiting to include them at a future date
when the HWP is assumed to start emitting its carbon.
This means these locked-in carbon emissions are not
represented in the accounting for years, delaying a full
picture of logging's climate impacts.
Some HWPs can replace certain carbon-intensive building
materials like concrete, bolstering their climate benefit.
However, this depends on truly sustainable logging
practices and should be incorporated into climate policy
only after a robust, peer-reviewed analysis of the full
carbon life cycle of Canadian boreal forest wood products.
If the Canadian building sector is to move toward using
more wood products, it has to start with an accurate
assessment of what it would mean for emissions that come
from forestry and the wood products it produces. Once the
estimates of life-cycle emissions more accurately depict
reality, it will then become clear which practices are truly
part of the solution to address climate change.
It must also be taken into account that much of what
the forest industry ultimately produces isn’t actually
long-lasting. Although Canada's carbon accounting does
consider the differing lifespans of the sector's forest
products, long-lived HWPs have received outsized weight
in Canadian policy, particularly given the significant
role shorter-lived products also play in the marketplace
(Figure 2). More than 40 percent of the revenue from the
manufacture of forest products in Canada comes from
short-lived pulp and paper.130 For example, the U.S. tissue
industry is a significant importer of virgin forest fiber
from Canada, purchasing more than 1.75 million tons of
boreal pulp each year.131 These products are used once
and discarded, after which they add to the rising carbon
concentration in the atmosphere. Since a significant
amount of the logged material quickly ends up in landfills or
sewers, where they emit carbon and methane, the logging
industry’s claims about their contributions to carbon
storage obfuscate the actual life span of many of their
products.
At the same time, biomass production and export is also
growing in Canada,132 further undermining industry
arguments concerning their products’ carbon storage
capacity. Biomass, which consists of plants and plant
by-products to be burned for fuel, is not a clean energy
alternative to fossil fuels. When burned, biomass, at the
point of combustion, usually has a carbon impact greater
than that of coal and other fossil fuels133 and creates a
carbon debt that can last hundreds of years.134
While markets exist for tissue paper and biomass, this
does not absolve the Canadian forest industry from
responsibility for the impacts of delivering these products.
Like the coal, oil, and natural gas companies that feed a
global fossil fuel market, the forest industry is responsible
for enabling those markets to exist and should take
responsibility for the biodiversity and climate impacts of its
activities and products.
Finally, it is important to note that even long-lived HWPs
are not an immediate source of emissions reductions. Even
if they meet the narrow conditions for acting as climatefriendly products, it takes decades to realize the climate
benefits from HWPs given the long timescale of forest
regrowth. Therefore, these benefits would come too late to
contribute to the emissions pathways the IPCC has outlined
for keeping warming below 1.5 °C. Forests left intact,
however, continue to provide immediate climate benefits
in the form of stored carbon, helping achieve this target
within the needed time frame. 
Recommendations
As the Canadian government pursues a more resilient, just,
sustainable future, it will need to prioritize the protection
of the boreal forest’s value for the climate. Doing so means
protecting remaining intact and primary forests and,
where industrial logging does occur, incentivizing climatefriendlier practices. In addition to positioning Canada as
a leader on nature-based climate solutions, these policy
recommendations would provide numerous co-benefits,
including advancing Canada’s reconciliation commitments
to Indigenous Peoples and biodiversity protections. These
recommendations should also be included as part of a green
recovery plan, as each presents opportunities for jobs and
economic stimulus.
CANADA SHOULD FULLY ACCOUNT FOR THE
LOGGING INDUSTRY’S EMISSIONS
Canada has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, in
alignment with the IPCC’s recommendations.135 However,
by undercounting forestry’s emissions and exempting them
from regulation, Canada could severely undermine this
commitment. The federal government is continuing to hone
its greenhouse gas accounting procedures, and as part of
this effort it must accurately monitor how well forests
are actually recovering from logging and incorporate
these findings into its accounting practices. This should
document impacts not only from reduced tree cover, but
also from the potentially higher-than-reported rates of
deforestation found in provinces like Ontario.
Canada needs to also account for the differences between
the carbon-sequestering capabilities of the intact forest
and the capabilities of second-growth forests, as well
as the carbon debt incurred when carbon-rich natural
landscapes are converted through logging to carbon-poor
landscapes. This requires a better understanding of how
both natural and human-caused disturbances impact soil
carbon storage. Developing a more robust understanding of
these dynamics will help ensure that Canada’s accounting
actually reflects the true carbon balance and does not
inadvertently undermine the goals of the Paris Agreement.
In addition, because Canada relies on a model rather than
direct data for its reporting, the government should clearly
communicate these uncertainties and urge provinces and
industry to adopt the precautionary principle in their
logging and forest management policies.   
CANADA SHOULD REGULATE THE LOGGING
INDUSTRY’S EMISSIONS
The Canadian government should integrate logging
emissions into its national carbon pricing program under
the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act. Revenue
generated from pricing forestry emissions should then
be invested into reversing forest degradation; promoting
climate-friendly forestry and forest adaptation to climate
change; increasing research and monitoring; helping
forestry-dependent communities, especially Indigenous
communities, to expand economic alternatives; and
developing industries around alternative, more sustainable
materials to address global demand.
Where logging continues in non-intact forests, this
regulation would provide incentives to both provincial
governments and industry to adopt climate-friendlier
forest management practices that reduce impacts on the
ecosystem’s stored carbon and improve regeneration.
Such practices include adopting longer harvest rotations,
avoiding full-tree logging, selective harvesting, and
facilitating regeneration centered on biodiversity and
climate considerations.
CANADA SHOULD PROTECT REMAINING
INTACT FORESTS
The federal government has outlined a policy platform
to promote nature-based climate solutions, including a
commitment to invest C$3 billion over 10 years to plant
two billion net additional trees across Canada.136 While
important, tree planting does not mitigate the damage done
by clearcutting intact forests, which have a carbon benefit
that is irreplaceable under any meaningful time frame. As a
result, it is essential for the Canadian government to adopt
robust protection for this globally vital ecosystem.
Under the Convention on Biological Diversity, Canada’s
federal government has committed to protecting 17 percent
of its lands and inland waters by 2020, and has additionally
promised to protect 25 percent by 2025, and 30 percent by
2030. These are strong and important commitments. With
only about 10 percent of the boreal forest’s carbon stores
currently protected,137 Canada needs to make the protection
of intact regions in its managed forests a central element of
meeting these commitments. In addition, where provinces
are failing to protect critical boreal caribou habitat in intact
forests, the federal government should employ laws, such
as the Species at Risk Act, that enable them to step in and
implement the needed safeguards.

CANADA SHOULD PRIORITIZE INDIGENOUS-LED
LAND MANAGEMENT
Strong Indigenous land rights are not only critical to
Indigenous self-determination and empowerment, but
are also correlated with better protections for forest
carbon and healthier forest ecosystems, including higher
biodiversity.138 In Canada, Indigenous Peoples have
been at the forefront of more effective, sustainable land
management, including through Indigenous-led protected
areas and Guardians programs.139 Their leadership is
critical not only to empowering Indigenous Nations to
determine their own futures, but also to ensuring that
the forest is managed sustainably for the climate and
biodiversity.
The Canadian government has taken positive initial steps to
support Indigenous leadership, giving C$25 million to fund
a pilot Indigenous Guardians Network and C$175 million in
part to fund over 60 Indigenous-led protection initiatives.140
While this funding is significant, it is a fraction of what
Indigenous communities need to safeguard their traditional
territories and manage the remaining intact boreal forests.
Additional funding for Indigenous-led management should
come from diverted logging subsidies for non-Indigenousled operations, carbon pricing, and other sources to
support this critical work. 
Conclusion
Forests are our best natural allies, and if the world is going
to reduce its emissions rapidly enough to avoid exceeding
1.5 °C of warming, we need all the help we can get. Focusing
exclusively on energy decarbonization, while vital,
misses a critical piece of the climate puzzle. In addition to
phasing out fossil fuel emissions, countries must protect
their carbon-rich ecosystems and enhance their ability
to sequester carbon. To this end, countries with large
remaining intact forest areas must do everything in their
power to conserve and enhance these essential climate
regulators. Doing so will not only protect our climate but
help stem the global loss of species. We can no longer
simply value forests such as the boreal for their supply of
toilet paper, newsprint, and lumber, nor can the logging
industry continue its current unsustainable practices.
Canada is the steward of a significant portion of the world’s
most carbon-dense, intact ecosystem, and it therefore
has an essential role to play. It has made significant
commitments that position the country to be a key leader
on nature-based climate solutions. But with the ongoing,
significant loss of intact boreal forests from industrial
extraction and the failure to transition to climate-friendlier
logging practices, time is running out. The Canadian
boreal’s carbon stores can be a critical resource or a
devastating carbon bomb in the fight to protect our future.
It’s time for Canada to close the logging loophole, step into
the climate leadership role it claims, and fully prioritize
this global climate linchpin, safeguarding the forest in its
indispensable role as one of the world’s greatest climate
allies.
