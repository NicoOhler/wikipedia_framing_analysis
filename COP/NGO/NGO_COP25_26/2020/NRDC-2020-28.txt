Executive Summary	

Millions of workers in the United States get injured or sick on the job every year, and
thousands die.1 Although the rates of occupational injuries and deaths have declined
since the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was established in 1971,
workers still face countless hazards—from the physical stress of repetitive motions to
chainsaw accidents to landslides.2
Climate change is already making existing workplace hazards worse and creating
new ones, and the situation will only accelerate as our world gets even hotter and our
weather more extreme.3 Outdoor workers will be exposed to more severe heat, more
toxic substances, and a heightened risk of infectious diseases. As increasingly extreme
weather events destroy infrastructure and threaten communities, first responders and
cleanup crews will face ever more frequent, exhausting, and dangerous deployments.
And as the world grapples with the magnitude of the climate crisis and the societal
upheaval it causes, workers across the occupational spectrum may have to provide aid
to colleagues or to people in their care who find themselves in mental distress.

  “As fiber-optic technicians, we connect businesses to high-speed internet service. To do this, we often have to block off an area in the middle
  of a six-lane highway and open up a 300-pound manhole lid made of cast iron. Then we pump the water out of the tunnel and climb down
  underneath the highway to snake the fiber-optic cable through the conduit system to the business’s computer server room. In central Florida
  the summers have gotten horrendously hot, so the asphalt is sizzling and the tunnels can get up to 112 degrees [Fahrenheit].

  didn’t used to be this hot, but in recent years I’ve seen a lot of guys get overheated and dehydrated. They get nauseous, their body shuts down,
  they stop sweating, their skin gets cold and clammy, and they get the shakes. When this happens, I try to get them to a cooler location and get
  liquid into them, but you have to give them water slowly because otherwise they can throw it up.
  “Along with the heat, there are more intense storms and hurricanes, which threaten service for customers because the lines get flooded and
  corroded. We have to cut out all the damaged cables and junction boxes and replace them. Sometimes in the aftermath of storms, we’ve worked
  18 to 20 hours a day and slept in our trucks. We wouldn’t go home for weeks until service was restored for our customers.
  “I’m a fourth-generation Floridian, so I know firsthand that it’s getting hotter and we’re hit by more storms. My grandmother was 91 when she
  died, and had only seen one hurricane in this part of the state during her lifetime. I’m 62 and have seen seven or eight hurricanes already. I was

  “The increasing heat in Florida makes it hard to work in my industrial laundry, but the storms hurt my ability to make a living because they shut
  down the businesses that need laundry services.
  “I’m a single mom raising three kids ages sixteen, nine, and six. I make $12.55 an hour at the laundry, folding and assembling items once they’re
  clean so they can be wrapped and shipped out to customers. We clean hotel and restaurant linens, hospital sheets and scrubs, and uniforms for
  city workers. Inside our laundry, it can reach temperatures over 105 degrees in the summer, so it’s tough and exhausting work. I’ve stayed with
  it for 10 years because normally it provides a steady income at 40 hours a week so I can support my family.
  “That changed when Hurricane Michael hit in 2018. Michael was a category five and caused so much flooding and damage that many of the
  businesses that use our laundry were shut down, especially in Panama City on the Gulf Coast. The entire local economy took a hit. Our laundry
  closed for three days because the area lost power, but when the lights came back on, we could only work half days due to the loss of business.
  “So I only had around 26 hours a week at the laundry and had to find other work. I started a second job with an app-based food delivery service
  at night. I would get off from the laundry around 12:30 p.m. and then deliver food from 5 p.m. to about 11 p.m. Sometimes I only made around
  $10 an hour at the delivery job, and it was a real struggle to support my family. My car got repossessed, and I had to choose between paying my
  utility bills or the rent. The only reason we weren’t homeless was that I paid my other bills late every month.
  “When I was working that schedule, my mom had to come up from Miami to assist with the kids and stay with them at night. My children barely
  got to see me, which was really hard on them. When they were going to school I was going to work at the laundry, when they came home I was
  going to my delivery job, and then when I finally got home at night they were asleep. I wasn’t even able to help them with their homework. Once
  my youngest daughter said to me, ‘We never get to see you anymore,’ and it broke my heart. The drastic changes in the climate are causing
  insecurity and hardship for working families.”

EXTREME HEAT IS KILLING WORKERS
The average annual temperature of the contiguous United
States increased 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over roughly the
past century.19 Because warming happens unevenly, average
temperature increases of up to 3 °F have occurred in areas
such as Southern California, western Colorado, northern
North Dakota, and much of New Jersey.20 Heat waves have
also gotten longer, more frequent, and more intense in
recent decades.21
Without a dramatic reduction in the pollution causing
climate change, the United States could experience twice as
many days with a heat index greater than 100 °F between
the years 2036 and 2065 than in the period from 1971 to
2000.22 For context, the National Weather Service typically
issues heat advisories when the forecast calls for two

Heat is a serious occupational health threat, particularly
for workers engaged in strenuous physical labor.24 As both
average temperatures and the number of heat waves climb,
more and more workers in the United States will face costly
and life-threatening heat-related illnesses.25

                         From 1992 to 2016, heat killed more than 780 workers in the United States

than half of farm and construction workers—the two
groups most vulnerable to heat-related deaths—had paid
sick leave, compared with 80 to 90 percent of workers in
finance, insurance, real estate, and public administration.48
From 2013 to 2018, private sector workers in the United
States experienced an estimated 1,020 occupational cases
of nonfatal heat stroke that required time away from
work.49 About three-quarters of the cases resulted in one
to five days of time away. The worst 10 percent of cases,
however, resulted in lost-work time of a month or longer.50


Farm and Construction Workers
Workers in construction and agriculture will be hurt first,
and hurt most, by a continued rise in extreme heat days.

body heat, and heavy equipment that generates external                                 The health impacts of heat on farm and construction

                                    deaths, and the school bus needs to be a welcoming, nurturing environment. It’s also important to recognize, address, and report any bullying.

  “My area of Texas is getting hotter every year, and the storms are becoming more violent. When Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017, my 82-year-old
  great-aunt was living with me at the time. The storm was so powerful, it knocked trees over onto electrical lines, causing the power to go out in
  the area for a week.
   “The heat was incredibly intense and my great-aunt, who was diabetic, started to pant and go through heat exhaustion. My husband and I had
  to go on a scavenger hunt to find generators, gas, and power to get the air conditioner running in her room. We were afraid her health could be
  at risk, and we needed to keep her insulin refrigerated.
   “When the utility company tried to turn the electricity back on, the downed power lines would set trees and bushes on fire, so they’d have
  to shut it off again. My coworkers and my husband’s cousins came out to help clear debris off the lines because the company and local
  government were overwhelmed.
   “One of my neighbors across the street was an older gentleman and a veteran, and his wife was on hospice, in the process of dying. A tree had
  fallen on their home and smashed through the roof, and they had no power. We tried to help and support them as best we could. I felt terrible for
  them.
  “Everything was shut down, including hospitals, gas stations, and grocery stores. The hospital where I work was closed to new admissions
  for three to five days because of wind-driven rain and roof damage. For the patients who were already in my hospital when the storm hit, we
  couldn’t discharge some of them because their homes had been destroyed. Some were confused and traumatized; they just couldn’t wrap their
  minds around the fact that they didn’t have homes to go back to. It was like they were suddenly homeless.”

  “When Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina [in 2018], it flooded our roads and washed some of them completely away. I’ve been a lieutenant in

                                                                          was on leave from the military, and we came home to Georgia with our two children to surprise our
                                                                          families. He was staying at his parents’ home in East Albany and I was at my mother’s with the kids in
                                                                          South Albany, so we were separated by the river. When the rain started, my mom called me from the
                                                                          local hospital where she worked as a nurse and said to leave her home because a flood was coming.
                                                                          When I went outside the water was already halfway up the car tires.
                                 “My mother lost her entire home in the flooding. My children and I had to go to a shelter and spent two weeks there. For three days my mom
                                was stuck at her hospital, and then the National Guard brought her to join us at the shelter. The floodwaters and damage kept my ex-husband
                                from getting to us.
                                The experience was financially devastating and also emotionally disturbing for our whole family. There was so much human suffering in the
                                shelter. Some people were disabled and didn’t have proper accommodations, and others had urgent medical needs that went unmet.
                                 “When Hurricane Michael hit, it was another extremely difficult experience. We went 12 days without power, and it was a real struggle because
                                I was living with and caring for my disabled mom, who’s now 76 years old. By the time Michael got to us, it was still a category two storm, but
                                our city’s infrastructure isn’t designed to handle that. In my lifetime we’d never had a hurricane in this area. We’re three hours north of the
                                Florida state line and far inland.
                                “A hundred percent of the city lost power. Our water became contaminated with sewage and for weeks we had to boil it before we could drink
                                or bathe with it. Phone lines were down and cell phone towers were damaged, so our phones and internet weren’t working and we had no form
                                of communication. It was months before we got internet service back. My work was also shut down so we didn’t have any income coming in. We
                                went down to try get some help from the government so we could eat, and there must have been 1,000 people waiting in line for food stamps.
                                “Another way that climate change is affecting our community is the spread of insect-borne disease. It’s become so hot that the number of
                                mosquitoes has increased, because the winters aren’t cold enough to kill them off. There are more and more cases of West Nile each year. It’s
                                a vicious circle as the storms and flooding overwhelm our drainage and sewer system, and then the water just sits there, providing a breeding
                                ground for more mosquito eggs. The working class and poor neighborhoods are hit the hardest, where the infrastructure is the most in need of
                                repair.
                                “I know people are experiencing this kind of violent, erratic weather all over the U.S. When I hear there are over 90-degree temperatures in
                                Alaska, it’s clear global warming is a real problem for our whole country. I hope our government starts to proactively deal with these issues
                                by upgrading our infrastructure, promoting electric cars and charging stations, and creating more storm preparedness before it’s too late.”

                                                                           “For the past five years I’ve been working as an in-home supportive services provider, caring for
                                                                           seniors and people with disabilities. I put my entire heart into my job—it’s very personal, and I
                                                                           become bonded to my clients.
                                                                           “In October 2017, hundreds of wildfires broke out all over Northern California and were so out of
                                                                           control that they cut off Highway 101. My town is 1,500 feet up in the mountains and that highway
                                                                           is our only way in or out. We also had no way to communicate or get information because all the
                                                                           landlines and cell towers had burned, leaving us with no phones, radio, or internet.
                               “I didn’t know what was going on until all of a sudden I found out that the fires were only a mile away. I became really worried about the client I
                               was taking care of and the two senior complexes in town. I couldn’t get hold of the local social services agency or the sheriff, so I went myself
                               to see a friend who worked at one of the senior facilities. I told her we needed to do something, and she said, ‘Go door to door and ask the
                               residents if they have a way to get out. If not, we’ll commandeer the facility’s vans and evacuate them to a shelter.’ There was no pre-designed
                               plan to get folks out of there.
                               “Fortunately, that fire was brought under control before it destroyed our town, but the smoke and ash were choking. I have asthma, and the
                               smoky air caused me to have frequent coughing, tightness in my throat, sinus infections, and a heaviness in my chest when I tried to breathe.
                               Prior to becoming a home care worker, I was a respiratory therapist, and with my professional experience I was anxious about people with
                               chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases like emphysema.
                               “Then, in October 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric preemptively shut off power in our area for four days to prevent its equipment from causing
                               another outbreak of wildfires during high winds. But the power shutoff was a crisis in its own way. The temperature dropped down to 24 degrees
                               at night, and our house was freezing because like most people around here, we have electric heat. To cook, we set up a propane camping stove
                               on the deck.
                               “Another problem was that the power outage shut off medical devices such as oxygen machines and ventilators that seniors relied on.
                               Concentrators, the machines that make oxygen-rich gas from the surrounding air, couldn’t run, and the local company that sells oxygen tanks
                               ran out. My home care client at the time was a woman in her 60s with a chronic disease, and she could have gone unconscious or died if her
                               oxygen didn’t last.
                               “Even though home care providers and their families were suffering during the shutoff, they really went above and beyond for their clients. One
                               caregiver took hot water and blankets to a client, another stayed at the client’s home the entire time, and one brought the client to stay at her
                               own house. If it hadn’t been for home care workers, people would have died.
                               “These climate-related disasters are going to get worse, and more remote areas of the country will be particularly hard hit. We need local
                               governments, home care agencies, and health care facilities to put plans in place and prepare. For example, we need solar panels that can kick
                               in during power outages, especially for nursing homes and hospitals. We need a system to track, contact, and quickly evacuate seniors and
                               people with disabilities. We also need to increase the number of home care workers in our rural communities and improve their jobs so we can
                               recruit and retain caregivers. With the aging population, home care workers are the first responders who will go out, check on people, and save
                               lives.”
