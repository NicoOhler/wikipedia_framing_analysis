    BACKGROUND
    Protected areas and other conserved areas, such as indigenous and community
    conserved lands and sacred natural areas, have played a critical role in biodiversity
    conservation for the past century. Beyond providing a haven for species, these areas
    also provide vital ecosystem services that sustain livelihoods, connect landscapes,
    capture and store carbon, and inspire people to value the natural world. Healthy,
    well-managed protected areas are critical to the 2015 Paris Agreement’s ambitions of
    creating a low-carbon global economy and a climate-resilient world. The role of forests
    and other natural systems in sequestering carbon has been well-documented. Similarly,
    protected areas provide a suite of ecosystem services that help vulnerable communities
    during extreme weather events. These include protection from soil erosion due to heavy
    rainfall, coastal storm surge and wave attenuation, and flooding. National governments
    would benefit from acknowledging the benefits that nature provides by placing
    protected and other conserved areas at the center of their commitments to addressing
    climate-related challenges.

    However, almost all protected areas were designed, and continue to be managed, with
    the assumption of a stationary climate. Climate change is already causing shifts in
    species composition, habitat types, and ecosystem function, challenging their ability to
    meet goals and objectives they were designed for. As the climate continues to change,
    protected areas will be further impacted as people shift agricultural production, build
    new infrastructure, and move away from coasts and floodplains. To ensure these
    natural areas continue to deliver benefits, we must increase efforts to protect them
    from further degradation and climate change itself. By including conserved areas
    in Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, Parties can demonstrate
    commitment to nature-based solutions and emphasize the importance of protected
    natural areas to human well-being.

    With financial support from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature
    Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), WWF US conducted a review of currently
    available Nationally Determined Contributions to assess the extent of Parties’ use of
    protected and other conserved areas for adaptation and mitigation benefits, to identify
    promising approaches and gaps. Findings were used to develop recommendations for
    Parties to enhance the role of protected areas in their revised NDCs for submission to
    the UNFCCC in 2020 and beyond.

    A second objective of this study was to learn whether governments consider climate
    change risks to nature to better inform protected area management. Governments,
    protected area managers and conservation groups alike often neglect the increasing
    risk that climate change poses to protected areas and the ecosystem services they
    provide. Most planners and managers of the world’s protected areas do not consider
    climate risks, instead relying on traditional approaches to conservation that are rapidly
    becoming obsolete with increased warming and climate variability. WWF believes
    that a viable future for people and nature mandates that conservation efforts and
    strategies—including the management of protected and other conserved areas—are

                         variability considerations by 2025.”

                         Colombia’s NDC, while somewhat vague, is perhaps more comprehensive. It states
                         “100% of the national territory [will be] covered by climate change plans” which
                         ostensibly includes its protected and other conserved areas. In addition, according

                         to the NDC, “water resource management tools, which include climate change and

                         question, indicated by a “●” in the country results table in Appendix 1.

                         Notably, a few countries that do mention protected areas also discuss the need for
     KILOMETERS          biological corridors, an important climate-risk management strategy for biodiversity.
Marine species are       Although range shifts due to climate change vary greatly by species, a recent study
moving poleward at       found that on average, terrestrial species have shifted to higher latitudes at a rate of
an average rate of       16.9 kilometers per decade as a result of increased temperatures14. Marine species are
 72 kilometers per       moving poleward at an average rate of 72 kilometers per decade15. Species will need
      decade15           space to freely migrate to new locations as they seek suitable climates.

                         Ethiopia provides an example for corridors that other countries might replicate.
                         Its NDC states the intention to “create biodiversity movement corridors, especially
                         up towards higher terrain, in areas where most of the land is under cultivation. This
                         will minimize biodiversity loss through enabling the re-establishment and movement
                         of plant and animal species and varieties to areas suitable for their survival when
                         temperature rises.” Facilitating the movement of species through protected or managed
                         biological corridors will be crucial to minimizing biodiversity loss and ensuring
                         ecosystem services—including those needed for climate change adaptation and
                         mitigation.

                       To increase ambition and highlight the role of protected areas while inspiring others to
                       action, WWF developed five recommendations for Parties as they work to revise their
                       NDCs for 2020 or in 5-year cycles as agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement.

                       and related climate change policies.
                       Although more than one third of Parties included the role of protected and other
                       conserved areas in their NDCs, 83 countries and the European Union (representing 28
                       countries), did not. Clearly there are opportunities to strengthen the role of conserved

                             international carbon market prices6. While the country’s NDC briefly refers to the
                             carbon capture potential of ecosystems, it does not mention protected areas explicitly.
                             Similarly, Mexico’s protected areas store an estimated 2.2 billion tons of carbon
                             dioxide (worth more than $34 billion US dollars)6. While its NDC states an intent to

                             Given the potential that protected and other conserved areas can play in sequestering
                             carbon and avoiding emissions, Parties are encouraged to enhance their climate change

                             extent to which ecosystems can provide services in a changing climate19. If climate
                             change risks on ecosystems are not considered and managed, the benefits ecosystems
                             provide in reducing people’s vulnerability may be short-lived.

                             Given these challenges, Parties are encouraged to consider climate change risks
                             to nature and adopt climate-adaptive measures to manage them. These measures
                             should be included in revised NDCs as well as national commitments to other global
                             conventions.
