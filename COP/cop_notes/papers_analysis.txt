IGO:
    2015: near:
        +Sancity , Authority, Loyality
        -Subversion, Degredation
    2021/2025:
        it flipped to the opposite
        near:
        -Harm, Cheating, Betrayl
        +Fairness, Care
NGO:
        For  Sancity , Authority, the same as IGO
        Only Loyalty/Betrayl value stays the same over years
        For Fairness, Care the same as IGO - it flipped

Press:
    Press over Time2: 2008 is a outliner





LABLES:


IGO:
    2021 is an outliner on every catagory
NGO:
   no significant outliner
IGO vs NGO
    same pattern - no significat diviations in spikes
    IGOs - lower results in general
    NGOs - Politcal/Publicity is a bit more
    NGos - Economics/capacity more

IPCC:
    VERY low values in general (doesnt polarize ?)
    Main focus also on economics

NGO - way less values at political / Public compared to newspapers

Press 2008 - 2021:
    not very much change over the years
    only 2017 / 2009 seems like an outliner
FT:
    vs IGO/NGO: Way more political/Public - bit more economic
    Economic is no outliner compared to other newspapers
        - but is the only one which stands out compared to NYT
NYT:
    2021 outliner on every catagory
    higher numbers on every catagory except economic compared to FT
