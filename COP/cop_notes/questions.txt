is change linear?
    is a 0.1 diff near the middle equivalent to a 0.1 diff at one end of the scale?
    0 = Rechtsexterm, 1 = Linksextrem, 0.5 Mitte
        is da jump vo 0.5 auf 0.6 wirklich gleichbedeutend wie da 0.9 auf 1?

aggregate all COPs into one
    e.g. compare how NYT reported about COPs differently from FT
    takes into consideration that we dont have an equal amount of articles for all COPs
        e.g. very few FT articles for COP15, but many for COP21

write function which takes two dumps/plots and returns the difference 
    e.g. compare FT with average press,
         compare avg IGO, NGO, press

average problem
    more articles of one source might skew everything
    distribution
        FT 185 - 74 - 92
        NY 214 - 74 - 89
        Telegraph 88 - 97 - 85
        Guardian 0 - 175 - 94
        USAToday 0 - 57 - 109
    comparison of one source vs average of all other sources excluding itself would be interesting
        need to merge csvs for this - not too bad
