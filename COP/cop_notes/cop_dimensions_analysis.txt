Methodology:
    look for "significant" deviations from average
    problem: average skewed if source contributes more to avg,
                which is definitely the case for our data
    maybe compare each source with average of other sources?
        need to merge csvs for this - not too bad

Press vs NGO vs IGO
    are reports and press articles even comparable?
    very distintive writing style
    probably about different topics?
        reports give an overview/a summary
        press articles report often report about specific/concrete issues/incidents

    Press + NGO are rather consistent between COPs, IGO not
    NGO + IGO mostly similar, press different
    press slightly more harm - weniger sachlich?
    press more cheating, betrayal, subversion
        subversion - reason why
    sanctity - no clear pattern?
    IGO vs press
        fairness, loyalty, authority
        slightly more care
        sanctity/degradation varies, avg constant
    NGO vs press
        more sanc, auth, loyalty, fairness
        slighty more care
    NGO vs IGO
        harm, cheating, betrayal, subversion varies slightly, avg constant
        slightly more sanctity

COP15, 21, 25_26
    COP15
        more sanctity, authority
        slightly more care?
    no clear patterns for COP21, COP25_26
    press and NGO rather consistent, while IGO changed a lot
    press averages compared
        harm no changes
        cheating increased barely from 15 to 21 to 25/26
        betrayal slightly more in 21
        subversion increased from 15 to 21 to 25/26
        degradation way more in 25/26 only
    IGO averages compared
        no clear trends
        subversion betrayal, increased
        harm, cheating, degradation increased and then decreased slightly
    NGO averages compared
        harm cheating betrayal constant
        degradation subversion increased
