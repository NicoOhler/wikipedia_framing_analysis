Methodology:
    look for "significant" deviations from average
    problem: average skewed if source contributes more to avg,
                which is definitely the case for our data
    maybe compare each source with average of other sources?
        need to merge csvs for this - not too bad

Press vs NGO vs IGO
    are reports and press articles even comparable?
    very distintive writing style
    probably about different topics?
        reports give an overview/a summary
        press articles report often report about specific/concrete issues/incidents

    Press + NGO are rather consistent between COPs, IGO not
    NGO + IGO mostly similar, press different
    press slightly more harm
    press more cheating, betrayal, subversion
    sanctity - no clear pattern?
    IGO vs press
        fairness, loyalty, authority
        slightly more care
        sanctity/degradation varies, avg constant
    NGO vs press
        more sanc, auth, loyalty, fairness
        slighty more care
    NGO vs IGO
