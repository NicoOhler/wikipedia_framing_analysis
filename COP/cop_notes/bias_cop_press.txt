FT
    center, high factual
    seem to report about climate change in a rather calm, cool and collected manner
USA Today
    center to left center, mostly factual
    most articles are pretty neutral, but some almost read like a horror story
NYT
    left center, high factual
    seem to emphasize the harms of climate change
Guardian
    left center, medium factual
    uses rather gentle language, pretty optimistic, reports sometimes about "climate success stories"
Daily Telegraph
    right, medium factual
    seem to believe that science/economy/progress will solve the issue without additional intervention
    quote "The great catastrophe so feared by our new age Puritans has in a sense been averted already, if only they could see it. The free market is cracking the carbon challenge with a speed and efficiency that the environmental Left could never achieve."
    gives me some very subtle conspiracy vibes
