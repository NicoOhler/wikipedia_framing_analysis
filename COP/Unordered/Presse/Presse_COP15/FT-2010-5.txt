New study says global warming is undeniable
By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent

International scientists have injected fresh evidence into the debate over global warming, saying climate change is "undeniable" and shows clear signs of "human fingerprints" in the first big piece of research since the "Climategate" controversy.

The research, headed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is based on new data not available for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report of 2007, the target of attacks by sceptics in recent years.

The NOAA study drew on 11 different indicators of climate, and found that each one pointed to a world that was warming owing to the influence of greenhouse gases, said Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring at the UK's Met Office, one of the agencies participating.

Seven indicators were rising, he said. These were: air temperature over land, sea-surface temperature, marine air temperature, sea level, ocean heat, humidity, and tropospheric temperature in the "active-weather" layer of the atmosphere closest to the earth's surface.

Four indicators were declining: Arctic sea ice, glaciers, spring snow cover in the northern hemisphere and stratospheric temperatures.

"The whole of the climate system is acting in a way consistent with the effects of greenhouse gases. The fingerprints are clear. The glaringly obvious explanation for this is warming from greenhouse gases," Mr Stott said.

Some scientists hailed the study as a refutation of the claims made by sceptics during the so-called Climategate saga.

This involved accusations of flaws in the IPCC's landmark 2007 report and the release of hundreds of e-mails from climate scientists that appeared to show them distorting certain data.
