Carbon Trust and FSB at one on climate change action

From Mr Tom Delay

and Mr John Wright.

Sir, The item "Row over climate change claim" (Money, January 5) reported that the Federation of Small Businesses and the Carbon Trust are in disagreement on efforts by small companies to act on climate change. This is not the case; there is no row. In recent research the FSB revealed the overwhelming majority of small businesses are socially and environmentally responsible but need more guidance on the practical steps they can take to tackle climate change.

Carbon Trust's research shows that while the propensity of small businesses to act has increased dramatically over the past three years a significant number do not have plans or targets in place. Both our organisations recognise a lot is being done but there is more to do.

Tom Delay,

CEO, Carbon Trust

John Wright,

Chairman, Federation of Small Businesses
