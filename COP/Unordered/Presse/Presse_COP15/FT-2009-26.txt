Remove politics from the climate science debate

From Mr Mark Hudson.

Sir, Clive Crook brings common sense to the debate about global warming ("Trust public opinion on climate change", December 14).

But the arguments about action on climate change surely need to be put in a wider context. There is a massive cost involved in reducing carbon dioxide emissions (which seems to be the main area of focus). It is not just a matter of what or who we believe. One way or another, the costs will be borne by citizens, especially (and rightly) in the richer developing world. If we are serious about combating climate change, voters need to be faced with honest policies about the opportunity cost of initiatives to reduce global warming. Ultimately, to pay for significant action, citizens will have to be willing to reduce spending on areas such as healthcare and travel (via higher taxes and prices) in order to reallocate resources to ameliorate the environment. And success or failure will not be clear for decades.

This makes it all the more vital to gain public trust, with truly open, non-politicised science and honest expenditure priorities. The outcome of public choice should not be taken for granted.

Mark Hudson,
