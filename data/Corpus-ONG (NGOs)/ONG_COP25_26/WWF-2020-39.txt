WWF is one of the world’s largest and most experienced independent
conservation organizations, with over 5 million supporters and a global
network active in more than 100 countries. WWF’s mission is to stop
the degradation of the planet’s natural environment and to build a
future in which humans live in harmony with nature, by conserving the
world’s biological diversity, ensuring that the use of renewable natural
resources is sustainable, and promoting the reduction of pollution and
wasteful consumption.

                                      SAFEGUARD NATURE
                                      At a time when the world is reeling from the deepest global             The Living Planet Report 2020 shows that there is an opportunity
                                      disruption and health crisis of a lifetime, this year’s Living Planet   to heal our relationship with nature and mitigate risks of future
                                      Report provides unequivocal and alarming evidence that nature           pandemics but this better future starts with the decisions that
                                      is unravelling and that our planet is flashing red warning signs of     governments, companies and people around the world take today.

                                      outlines how humanity’s increasing destruction of nature is having      as the foundation for a healthy society and a thriving economy.
                                      catastrophic impacts not only on wildlife populations but also on
                                      human health and all aspects of our lives.                              We still have a chance to put things right. It’s time for the world to

                                      needed, one that so far our civilisation has failed to embrace: a       a carbon-neutral and nature-positive economy and society.
                                      transition to a society and economic system that values nature,         This is our best safeguard for human health and livelihoods in

                                      This is about rebalancing our relationship with the planet to
                                      preserve the Earth’s amazing diversity of life and enable a just,

                                      own survival.

                                      Nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in millions
                                      of years. The way we produce and consume food and energy,
                                      and the blatant disregard for the environment entrenched in our
                                      current economic model, has pushed the natural world to its limits.     Director General
                                      COVID-19 is a clear manifestation of our broken relationship with       WWF International
                                      nature. It has highlighted the deep interconnection between nature,
                                      human health and well-being, and how unprecedented biodiversity
                                      loss threatens the health of both people and the planet.

                                      It is time we answer nature’s SOS. Not just to secure the future of
                                      tigers, rhinos, whales, bees, trees and all the amazing diversity of
                                      life we love and have the moral duty to coexist with, but because
                                      ignoring it also puts the health, well-being and prosperity, indeed
                                      the future, of nearly 8 billion people at stake.

    CHAPTER 1
    AN SOS FOR NATURE
    The evidence is unequivocal – nature is being changed and
    destroyed by us at a rate unprecedented in history. The 2020
    global Living Planet Index shows an average 68% fall in
    populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish
    between 1970 and 2016. In this chapter we also look at life in
    the soil beneath our feet, insects, “the little things that run the
    world”, and plants, all of which provide fundamental support
    for life on Earth. From the biggest to the smallest living things
    on our planet, monitoring shows us that nature is in serious
    decline.

                      The 2020 global Living Planet Index shows an average 68%
                      decrease in monitored vertebrate species populations between 1970
                      and 2016.


                                       Using the data from 20,811 populations of 4,392 species, the 2020
                                       global LPI shows an average 68% decline in monitored populations
                                       between 1970 and 2016 (range: -73% to -62%).

                                       This year’s index includes 400 new species and 4,870 new

                     Zooming in on Latin America and the Caribbean
                     The 94% decline in the LPI for the tropical subregions of the
                     Americas is the most striking result observed in any region. The
                     conversion of grasslands, savannahs, forests and wetlands, the
                     overexploitation of species, climate change, and the introduction of
                     alien species are key drivers.


                    Stefanie Deinet and   Much of the overall decline in the 2020 Latin America and
                    Louise McRae (ZSL),   Caribbean LPI is driven by very negative trends in reptiles,
             Paula Valdujo (WWF-Brazil)   amphibians and fish – groups which, according to our data, are
                    and Marcio Martins    each affected by a different cocktail of threats. For reptiles, these
            (Universidade de São Paulo)   include land-use change and overexploitation. Freshwater fish are
                                          affected most by overexploitation in this dataset; however, habitat
                                          fragmentation due to hydropower development is already severely
                                          impacting populations in this region 11 and is predicted to pose an
                                          even greater threat in the future 12.

                                          For amphibians, disease and habitat loss are the biggest threats.
                                          The Atlantic Forest in Brazil has lost 87.6% of its natural vegetation
                                          since 1500, mostly during the last century, which has led to at
                                          least two amphibian extinctions and 46 species threatened with
                                          extinction 13. The infection rate of the chytrid fungus, which is
                                          impacting amphibians worldwide, is high among Atlantic Forest
                                          amphibians 14; and this, combined with climate change and land-
                                          use change, might have an even more dramatic impact on their
                                          populations in the coming decades.

                                          More than 2,000 species of amphibian are threatened with
                                          extinction 15, the highest current estimate among vertebrate
                                          groups. For amphibians in the LPI, disease is the main recorded
                                          threat. In El Copé in the highlands of central Panama, the chytrid
                                          fungus caused mass mortality, leading to the loss of 30 amphibian
                                          species and severely reducing the diversity of the local amphibian
                                          community 16.

                     creatures to the canopy
                     From the biggest to the smallest living things on Earth,
                     monitoring tells us that nature is under serious pressure.
                     Tigers and polar bears are well-known poster species in the
                     story of biodiversity decline, but what of the billions of tiny or
                     as-yet-undiscovered species that are also under threat? What
                     is happening to the life in our soils, biodiversity that plays a
                     critical role in the ecosystem services on which we depend?

                     America and Europe that may represent an early warning for
                     the rest of the world?

                     For the first time this Living Planet Report also investigates the
                     status of plants, which provide fundamental support for life on
                     Earth and are the basis of virtually all terrestrial ecosystems.
                     The number of documented terrestrial plant extinctions is twice
                     as high as for mammals, birds and amphibians combined.

                                          to an increase in soil functions and the provision of services. This
                                          includes support to plant growth as well as higher nutrient use

                     Ex situ conservation, which preserves species outside

                     there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual in the wild has

                     volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean in 1958 64, the parsley
                     fern was listed as Extinct on the 2003 IUCN Red List. However,
                     a 2009 survey rediscovered four plants on the island’s Green
                     Mountain. Spores were collected and cultured in vitro at the Royal
                     Botanic Gardens, Kew, where a living collection is maintained 65.
                     Plants have been reintroduced on Ascension and the species
                     reassessed as Critically Endangered 66.

                     in 2008 when the last known plant died at its only known location
                     in Rwanda 67. Yet, a recent comprehensive review suggests there
                     may still be hope for the future of some plants: it documents 431

                     that have since been rediscovered 51. The IUCN Red List documents
                     118 vascular plant species that are Extinct and 35 that are Extinct

                     species to have gone globally Extinct or Extinct in the Wild 51, 68.

                     The causes of extinction are varied but are largely driven by
                     anthropogenic activities including invasive species, agricultural
                     intensification, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Ex situ
                     conservation encompasses a wide range of techniques to preserve
                     species outside their natural habitat, including seed-banking and
                     cryopreservation (the use of very low temperatures to preserve
                     structurally intact living cells). These techniques provide us with
                     options for the future, and global efforts such as the Millennium
                     Seed Bank Partnership 69 have extensive seed-collecting
                     programmes in more than 100 countries and territories to provide
                     this interim protection of species.

                     created by the overflow from a single hot spring in Rwanda. The last plant desiccated and
                        died when the stream feeding the hot spring was diverted for local agriculture in 2008.
                       An ex situ collection is being maintained at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew: in the hope
                                                of a possible reintroduction if this fragile habitat can be restored.

                     Tracking trees:
                     building a picture of their global status
                     The first Global Tree Assessment will cover all 60,000 known
                     tree species across the planet to give us a complete picture of the
                     conservation status of the world’s trees.


          Malin Rivers and Emily Beech     The Global Tree Assessment is coordinated by Botanic Gardens
         (Botanic Gardens Conservation     Conservation International and the IUCN/SSC Global Tree
                          International)   Specialist Group 75. It works through an extensive global
                                           collaborative partnership with national Red List organisations,
                                           botanic gardens, NGOs, forestry institutes, universities, herbaria
                                           and taxonomic experts. Its goal is to produce a conservation
                                           assessment for every known tree species to identify and prioritise
                                           conservation action for trees of greatest conservation concern.

                                           First, a list of the world’s trees had to be collated. In April 2017,
                                           GlobalTreeSearch – a checklist of 60,000 unique tree species
                                           and their distribution – was completed 76. This list is continually
                                           updated with new species, new distributions and taxonomic
                                           changes. Second, a conservation assessment, using the IUCN Red
                                           List categories and criteria, is needed for each of the 60,000 tree
                                           species to evaluate their risk of extinction. In addition, information
                                           on distribution, population trends, threats and conservation actions
                                           is gathered.

                                           The Global Tree Assessment will give us a complete picture of the
                                           conservation status of the world’s trees. Beyond trees the results
                                           will also be vital for other biodiversity and ecosystems that depend
                                           on trees for their survival, to guide conservation action and ensure
                                           that biodiversity is managed, restored and saved from extinction.

in the northern hemisphere.

                              Lynn Dicks   Insects dominate the animal kingdom in their sheer number of
                      and Edgar Turner     species. More than a million have been described, but the latest
              (University of Cambridge)    estimates suggest there may be as many as 5.5 million insect species
                                           altogether, with most in the tropics 77. Insects carry out essential
                                           roles in all terrestrial ecosystems, including pollinating plants,
                                           regulating pests, processing nutrients in soil and providing food for
                                           other animals, leading E.O. Wilson to famously describe them as
                                           “the little things that run the world” 78.

                                           In Western Europe and North America, insect monitoring
                                           schemes and long-term studies show startlingly rapid, recent and
                                           ongoing declines in insect numbers, distributions or collective

                                           and are usually fairly conspicuous. As a result they have been
                                           monitored long-term, and on a national scale, in many countries

                                           While there are challenges in establishing schemes to regularly
                                           collect data in a consistent manner, one way is to harness the
                                           combined effort of trained professionals and volunteers who walk a
                                           set route under specific weather conditions and record the number
                                           of each butterfly species seen. The latest results show trends in 17
                                           typical grassland butterfly species for 16 European countries over
                                           28 years. The index shows a decline of 49% (range -71% to -13%)
                                           between 1990 and 2017 (Figure 9). Six of the 17 species show a
                                           decline, seven are stable and four are increasing.

                                           The decline in the butterfly index is largely attributed to the
                                           intensification of agriculture in Northwest Europe and the
                                           abandonment of grasslands in other areas 90. In Europe these

    CHAPTER 2
    OUR WORLD IN 2020
    In the last 50 years our world has been transformed by an
    explosion in global trade, consumption and human population
    growth, as well as an enormous move towards urbanisation.
    These underlying trends are driving the unrelenting destruction
    of nature, with humanity now overusing our natural capital
    at an unprecedented rate. Only a handful of countries retain
    most of the last remaining wilderness areas. As a result of
    our 21st century lifestyles our natural world is transforming
    more rapidly than ever before, and climate change is further
    accelerating the change.

MAPPING THE LAST WILDERNESS
AREAS ON EARTH
Advances in satellite technology allow us to visualise how the
Earth is changing in real time. Human footprint mapping
then shows where we are and aren’t impacting land on
Earth. The latest map reveals that just a handful of countries
– Russia, Canada, Brazil and Australia – contain most of
the places without a human footprint, the last remaining
terrestrial wilderness areas on our planet 74.

           James Watson (University of     In the last two decades increasingly powerful computing, which
                Queensland and WCS),       aims to track human pressure across Earth using a network of
            Brooke Williams (University    satellites combined with bottom-up census and crowd-sourced
                    of Queensland) and     data 75, allows us to quantify and locate even sparse human
             Oscar Venter (University of   settlements, low-intensity agricultural farming and road
             Northern British Columbia)    construction, and other forms of human pressure 76, 74.

                                           The new field of ‘cumulative human pressure mapping’ has helped
                                           to integrate this data to provide a new view of the terrestrial
                                           biosphere and humanity’s role in shaping its patterns and processes
                                           (Figure 18). The latest human footprint map clearly shows the
                                           spatial extent of humanity’s environmental footprint, with 58% of
                                           the land’s surface under intense human pressure (Figure 19). Since
                                           2000, 1.9 million km2, an area the size of Mexico of ecologically
                                           intact land – that is, ecosystems that remain free from significant
                                           direct human pressure – has been lost, with most losses occurring
                                           within the world’s tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannah
                                           and shrubland ecosystems, and the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It
                                           also illustrates that only 25% of terrestrial Earth can be considered
                                           ‘wilderness’ (i.e. areas having no human footprint score), and that
                                           most of this is contained in just a small number of nations – Russia,
                                           Canada, Brazil and Australia.

ecosystems.

                      Derek P. Tittensor   Nowhere in the ocean is entirely unaffected by humans 79: only 13%
                  (Dalhousie University)   of its area is considered to be wilderness 80, waste and marine litter
                                           are found even in deep ocean trenches 81, and human pressures
                                           are increasing over time 82. The negative effects of these impacts
                                           threaten the goods and services – such as food provision, climate
                                           regulation, carbon storage and coastal protection – that marine
                                           ecosystems provide to human society, and upon which we
                                           all depend.

                                           The UN FAO estimates that fish consumption (including
                                           freshwater) provides more than 3.3 billion people with at least
                                           20% of their animal protein intake, and that the fisheries and
                                           aquaculture sectors provide direct employment for 59.5 million
                                           people 83. Nearly 200 million people depend on coral reefs to help
                                           protect them from storm surges and waves 84.

                                           Fishing for human consumption is considered to have the
                                           greatest impact on ocean biodiversity 2, causing one in three fish
                                           stocks assessed to be considered overfished 85 and leading to the
                                           unintended bycatch of species such as sharks, seabirds and turtles 86.

                                           In addition to fishing, numerous other impacts – such as pollution,
                                           including plastic pollution, and coastal development – affect our
                                           oceans through a variety of mechanisms (Figure 20). Climate
                                           change will increasingly interact with these stressors. It has already

                                           continue to grow in future. These will include causing species to
                                           shift their ranges as the ocean warms 88, coral bleaching 89 and the
                                           additional challenges posed by ocean acidification for these and
                                           other calcifying organisms, an increase in extreme weather events,

    CHAPTER 3
    PEOPLE AND NATURE ARE
    INTERTWINED
    Nature is essential for human existence and a good quality
    of life, providing and sustaining the air, freshwater and soils
    on which humanity depends. While more food, energy and
    materials than ever before are being supplied to people in most
    parts of the world, this is increasingly coming at the expense
    of nature’s ability to provide them in the future. People’s
    perceptions of environmental risk are changing and is clear
    that biodiversity conservation is a non-negotiable, strategic
    investment for our health, our wellbeing and our daily lives.

                     healthy planet, healthy people
                     The past century has seen extraordinary gains in human health
                     and well-being. This is rightly celebrated, but it has been partially
                     achieved through the exploitation and alteration of the world’s
                     natural systems, which threatens to undo these successes.


                   Thomas Pienkowski       There have been tremendous gains in human health in the past
                   and Sarah Whitmee       50 years. For instance, child mortality among under-5s has halved
                  (University of Oxford)   since 1990 15, the share of the world’s population living on less
                                           than $1.90 a day fell by two-thirds over the same period 16, and life
                                           expectancy at birth is around 15 years higher today than it was
                                           50 years ago 17.

                                           These trends are positive, but they have in part been achieved
                                           through the exploitation and alteration of the world’s natural
                                           systems. Current levels of environmental change undermine the
                                           capacity of these natural systems to continue to benefit humanity,
                                           and also create new threats to health 18. Nature’s contributions to
                                           health are diverse, from traditional medicines and pharmaceuticals
                                           derived from plants to water filtration by wetlands (see our
                                           accompanying “deep dive” into freshwater) 19, 20. As such, the loss
                                           of nature threatens to slow and, in some cases, reverse these
                                           positive health and well-being trends.

                                           In recognition of this, in 2015 the Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet
                                           Commission introduced the concept of ‘Planetary Health’, defining
                                           it as “the health of human civilization and the state of the natural
                                           systems on which it depends”, recognising that nature and human
                                           well-being are deeply linked 21.

                                           An example of this is the emergence of zoonotic diseases driven,
                                           in part, by environmental degradation 22. The global coronavirus
                                           pandemic has caused incredible human suffering and social and
                                           economic upheaval. Although the origins of COVID-19 remain
                                           uncertain, 60% of emerging infectious diseases come from animals,
                                           and nearly three-quarters of these from wild animals 8, 23.

                                   These diseases can spill over into humans in a variety of ways,                        © Olivier Langrand / WWF

                                   sometimes through direct contact with wild animals, but often
                                   through intermediary hosts such as domestic animals 24.

                                   The rate of infectious disease emergence has drastically increased
                                   over the last 80 years 8, with one study suggesting that diseases
                                   originating in animals cause 2.5 billion cases of illness, and nearly
                                   3 million deaths, each year 25. Given that many of these diseases
                                   come from wildlife, preventing the next pandemic might depend on
                                   understanding how humanity’s relationship with nature contributes
                                   to the emergence of these diseases.

                                   We do know that nearly half of all new emerging infectious
                                   diseases from animals are linked to land-use change, agricultural
                                   intensification and the food industry 26. Agricultural and industrial
                                   expansion into natural areas often disrupts ecological systems that
                                   regulate pathogenic risk, particularly in the biodiverse tropics 27, 28.
                                   This can lead to close contact between wildlife, livestock and people,
                                   increasing the chance that a disease will spill over into humans 29.

                                   There are also concerning examples of diseases emerging
                                   through the use and trade of wildlife, such as HIV/AIDS linked to
                                   chimpanzee consumption, SARS connected to markets containing
                                   wildlife, and Ebola linked to the hunting of great apes 30-32. These
                                   examples illustrate the complex links and trade-offs between
                                   nature, health and other aspects of human well-being. For instance,
                                   terrestrial wild meats make vital contributions to the health and
                                   livelihoods of millions of people globally 33, 34.

                                   Diseases like COVID-19, originating from animals, are one of the
                                   many connections between the health of people and the planet.
                                   Other kinds of environmental change, such as climate change and

                                   can benefit both people and the planet. How humanity chooses to

                                   looming threats from global environmental change, will influence
                                   the health of generations to come.

                     It’s better being green:
                     health and well-being in cities
                     A growing body of evidence confirms that it is
                     good for everyone’s health and well-being to be
                     able to engage with green and natural spaces near
                     to home. Good access to such natural places can
                     help reduce health inequalities.


 Catharine Ward      Links between access to green space and the health and well-
       Thompson      being of urban residents have been recognised throughout
     (OPENspace      history and were one of the driving forces behind the urban
 research centre,    parks movement of the 19th century in Europe and North
    University of    America 35. However, until recently, many of the mechanisms
       Edinburgh)    behind such links were poorly understood or lacked rigorous
                     scientific evidence. Recently, new research techniques have
                     provided opportunities to study what lies behind associations
                     between green space and health with increasing sophistication.
                     This is demonstrating associations between access to green or
                     natural environments and a range of health outcomes, including
                     lower probabilities of cardiovascular disease 36, obesity 37,
                     diabetes 38, asthma hospitalisation 39, mental distress 40
                     and, ultimately, mortality 41 among adults; and lower risks of
                     obesity 42 and myopia 43 in children. More green space in the
                     neighbourhood is also associated with better self-reported
                     health 44, 45, 43, subjective well-being 46 in adults, improved birth
                     outcomes 47-49, and cognitive development in children 45. Recent
                     epidemiological studies have revealed that access to urban
                     green space may have lifelong effects on health, with childhood
                     access to green space, for example, predicting cognitive health
                     and mental well-being in people aged 70 years or more 50-52.

                     Current evidence linking green space and health is
                     predominantly from the Global North. Urban green space
                     might also bring ecosystem disservices to some cities globally,
                     including fostering the spread of infectious diseases and
                     problematic interactions with wildlife, yet there is nonetheless
                     an argument for urban green space as a fundamental element
                     of sustainable, healthy and liveable cities, including in the
                     Global South 53. Investing in environmental interventions, such
                     as extending the amount of urban green space and improving
                     its quality and connectedness, has the potential to offer multiple      Norway maple (Acer platanoides)

                     Sowing the seeds to connect with nature
                     New research is beginning to show how children’s experiences
                     of nature have long-term effects in the ways they value, and take
                     action for, nature as adults.


                   Riyan van den Born    What motivates people to act for nature?
         (Radboud University Nijmegen)
                                         We know that people act for nature because it has instrumental
                                         value, that is, it improves our income or health; for moral value,
                                         for instance its intrinsic right to exist; and because of its relational
                                         value, for example connectedness and living a meaningful
                                         life 55, 56. In seven European countries we studied people who were
                                         committed activists for nature and found that the desire to live
                                         a meaningful life was the primary energising force of committed
                                         action 57. Other studies have demonstrated that living a meaningful
                                         life “is a fundamental component of human well-being” 58, and
                                         therefore a basic human motivation.

                                         Recognising the importance of feeling connected to nature
                                         raises the question of how this connection is developed and
                                         can be strengthened. Studies show that in order to establish a
                                         connection to nature, it is first important to be in contact with
                                         nature in early childhood; and having intense, and autonomous,
                                         childhood experiences in nature is crucial as well 59. This makes
                                         children’s access to nature of vital importance, especially since
                                         more and more children are growing up in urban areas where
                                         nature experiences can be scarce. Our work confirms that intense
                                         encounters with nature without supervision 60 are vital for building
                                         this connectedness 61 which is a key condition for commitment to,
                                         and action for, nature conservation in later life.

                     and saves lives
                     Healthy eating can help to save biodiversity and tackle diet-related
                     disease risk – the leading cause of premature mortality globally.

                 Fabrice DeClerck (EAT)   What food we produce and consume, how and where we produce
                                          that food, and how much is lost or wasted will determine whether
                                          we can provide a healthy diet, within environmental limits, for a
                                          global population of 10 billion people by 2050 79-82.

                                          For far too long we have been presented with a trade-off between
                                          food security or conservation, with ‘feed the world’ narratives
                                          presented as over-riding those to do with conservation. In the age
                                          of the Anthropocene this is finally changing, with the realisation
                                          that food is failing society both on health and environment grounds.
                                          Diet-related disease risk is the primary driver of premature
                                          mortality globally, and food production is the primary driver of
                                          biodiversity loss and water pollution. It also accounts for 20-30% of
                                          greenhouse gas emissions.

                                          Many models suggest that food security, nutritional security,
                                          climate security, environmental security and livelihood security are
                                          possible, and that innovative solutions emerge when these goals are
                                          considered as equally non-negotiable 81, 82. These are the five ‘ands’
                                          of the Andthropocene.

                                          Overconsumption in general, and more specifically
                                          overconsumption of meat, has important impacts on both human
                                          and planetary health. The planetary health diet 82 is one that retains
                                          significant flexibility of choice among major food groups while
                                          providing guidance which, if followed, would make it possible to
                                          feed a global population of 10 billion while halting the conversion
                                          of intact ecosystems, and help reduce premature deaths by 11
                                          million each year 79-81. It starts with the assumption that all people,
                                          irrespective of wealth, are entitled to a sufficient (±2,500 kcal per
                                          day) and diverse diet with a balanced proportion of protective foods
                                          – that is, foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals that provide
                                          immunity, and significantly protect our body from various diseases
                                          and infections. These include whole grains, fruits, nuts, vegetables,
                                          beans and pulses; and fish, eggs, dairy and other animal-sourced
                                          meats in moderation where desired.

                     buffering against hunger and climate change
                     Andean native potatoes comprise a wealth of biodiversity that could
                     contribute to the food security of an increasingly crowded, climate-
                     stressed world. Conserving them is essential.


                    Ginya Truitt Nakata    Since the first tubers were taken from South America to Europe
           (International Potato Center)   in the 16th century the potato has spread across the globe and is
                                           now the world’s third most consumed crop. However, it is highly
                                           susceptible to disease, as Ireland’s Great Famine proved, and
                                           vulnerable to the weather extremes exacerbated by climate change.

                                           The Andes region is the birthplace of the potato and is home to at
                                           least 4,500 types of native tuber cornucopia, including more than
                                           100 wild potato species. Local farmers grow and eat an array of
                                           native potatoes that together provide relatively high levels of zinc,
                                           iron, potassium, vitamin C and antioxidants, and are fundamental
                                           to the health of Indigenous communities.

                                           Adaptable and highly productive, the potato has saved millions
                                           from hunger. Yet one study has estimated that climate-induced
                                           weather extremes could drive 13 wild potato species to extinction
                                           by 2055 – and we know that the loss of just one species could be
                                           catastrophic. In 2007 one of many unexpected frosts wiped out
                                           the entire potato harvest in Peru’s Huancavelica region, except
                                           for yana. This single variety came between local families and
                                           extreme hunger.

                                           The Andes’ potato agrobiodiversity remains key to strengthening
                                           the resilience of farming communities and is used by scientists
                                           to breed nutritious, disease-resistant potato varieties for the
                                           world. The International Potato Center recognises biodiversity’s
                                           fundamental contribution to human and planetary health, and
                                           works with Andean farmers to maintain potato diversity. Just one
                                           of these varieties could hold the key to alleviating the next global
                                           hunger crisis 83.

                     The Dasgupta Review on the
                     Economics of Biodiversity
                     The Dasgupta Review explores the sustainability of our
                     engagements with nature: what we take from it; how we transform
                     what we take from it and return to it; why we have disrupted
                     nature’s processes; and what we must urgently do differently to
                     enhance our collective wealth and well-being, and that of our
                     descendants.


          Emily McKenzie, Ant Parham,   The Dasgupta Review is an independent, global review on the
                   Mark Anderson and    economics of biodiversity commissioned by HM Treasury – the
                   Haroon Mohamoud      UK’s economic and finance ministry – in 2019 86. In its framing, the
              (Dasgupta Review Team)    Review shows how humanity, and our economies, are embedded
                                        within – rather than external to – nature, helping us to recognise
                                        the limits nature places on the economy and, in so doing, reshape
                                        our understanding of sustainable economic growth.

                                        A number of central economic and scientific concepts underpin the
                                        Review’s work. These include the need to recognise that biodiversity
                                        is an essential characteristic of nature, playing an important role in
                                        the provision of ecosystem services on which our economies rely;
                                        to view nature as an asset, just as produced and human capital
                                        are assets, and acknowledge that we are failing to manage our
                                        assets efficiently; to understand that the loss of nature is an asset
                                        management problem; to assess how our total demand on nature
                                        outstrips its ability to supply goods and services on a sustainable
                                        basis; and to accept that addressing the supply-demand imbalance
                                        means confronting difficult questions, including questions about
                                        what and how we consume, how we manage our waste, and the role
                                        family planning and reproductive health can play.

                     seed bank, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway, provides

                     banks are used by researchers and plant breeders to develop
                     new, improved crop varieties. They have also provided farmers
                     with varieties they have lost. The International Treaty for Plant
                     Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture provides the rules

    IMAGINING A ROADMAP FOR
    PEOPLE AND NATURE
    Our imagination creates the new worlds we could live in.
    Now, the remarkable rise in computing power and artificial
    intelligence allows us, with ever-increasing sophistication, to
    look at a range of complex possible futures asking not only
    ‘what?’, but also ‘what if? These models are all telling us the
    same thing: that we still have an opportunity to flatten, and
    reverse, the loss of nature if we take urgent and unprecedented
    conservation action and make transformational changes in the
    way we produce and consume food.

                                    Using eight models allowed the modelling to not only capture
                                    uncertainties, but also to grasp five facets of biodiversity: the extent
                                    of suitable habitat, wildlife abundance, compositional intactness
                                    of ecological communities, and regional and global species

DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE
FUTURE WE WANT
Complementing the roadmap emerging from the Bending
the Curve Initiative, other new modelling has evaluated
the effectiveness of two contrasting conservation planning
strategies, each combined with measures to meet global
climate and food security targets. Both are able to bend the
curve of biodiversity loss, but this is only possible when
combined with strong climate mitigation.

            Nijmegen, The Netherlands)      the next decade. At the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in
                                            Glasgow, countries were to submit their new long-term emission
                                            reduction goals; the UN Convention on Biological Diversity was to
                                            meet in Kunming in China to agree a new framework and targets;
                                            and a Leader’s Biodiversity Summit was planned for October in New
                                            York as part of the UN’s 75th anniversary celebrations.

                                            Most of these conferences have been pushed into 2021, but much
                                            of the work helping to underpin the decision-making has been
                                            done. This included new scenario projections with the IMAGE-
                                            GLOBIO framework that explored the ability of two contrasting
                                            conservation planning strategies to bend the curve of biodiversity
                                            loss, while incorporating measures to safeguard global food security
                                            and limit global warming to well below 2°C. By looking at these
                                            goals simultaneously, some of the potential trade-offs from climate
                                            mitigation could be addressed while exploring the full mitigation
                                            potential of land-based measures.

                                            The IMAGE-GLOBIO modelling framework 16, 17 was used to explore
                                            the effectiveness of these two contrasting strategies under the
                                            assumptions of a business-as-usual trend for population growth
                                            and socio-economic development (SSP2). It also aimed to achieve

                                    and the extension of protected and conservation areas.                        suggest a need to combine both conservation strategies, such

                                    In contrast, the second conservation strategy – the ‘sharing the              surrounded by human-used land that is managed favourably for
                                    planet’ scenario – aims to support biodiversity while providing               biodiversity and ecosystem services provisioning 15.

                                    biodiversity targets with the achievement of a good quality of life.

                                            from agriculture and land-use change, and food security by 2050.

                                            Our 2019 results show that at least 50% of the Earth’s terrestrial

                     THE PATH AHEAD

                     The Living Planet Report 2020 is being published at a time
                     of global upheaval, yet its key message is something that has
                     not changed in decades: nature – our life-support system –
                     is declining at a staggering rate. We know that the health of
                     people and that of our planet are increasingly intertwined;
                     the devastating forest fires of the past year and the ongoing
                     COVID-19 pandemic have made this undeniable.

                     The Bending the Curve modelling tells us that, with
                     transformational change, we can turn the tide of biodiversity
                     loss. It is easy to talk about transformational change, but how
                     will we, living in our complex, highly connected modern society,
                     make it a reality? We know that it will take a global, collective
                     effort; that increased conservation efforts are key, along with
                     changes in how we produce and consume our food and energy.
                     Citizens, governments and business leaders around the globe
                     will need to be part of a movement for change with a scale,
                     urgency and ambition never seen before.

                     We want you to be part of this movement. For ideas and
                     inspiration, we invite you to explore our Voices for a Living
                     Planet supplement. We have invited thinkers and practitioners
                     from a range of fields in many countries to share their views on
                     how to bring about a healthy planet for people and nature.

                     Voices for a Living Planet complements the themes of the
                     Living Planet Report 2020 by reflecting a diversity of voices
                     and opinions from all over the globe. Covering ideas ranging
                     from human rights and moral philosophy to sustainable finance
                     and business innovation, it provides a starting point for hopeful
                     conversations, food for thought and ideas for a future in which
                     people and nature can thrive.

                     We hope it will inspire you to be part of the change.
