                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                              Seemingly every day around the world, new climate extremes are emerging that call
                              into question the development paradigms of the 20th century and the fundamental
                              ability of our existing infrastructure to meet the basic food, water, and energy needs of
                              millions. There is perhaps no better recent example than yet another destructive fire
                              season in California, where a stalled high-pressure system from a lethargic jet stream
                              slowed by warming sent 70-90 mph winds for days across a tinderbox of vegetation
                              and soil similarly dried out by new heat extremes. For the first time ever, the state’s
                              largest utility shut down large swaths of its power grid for days at a time until the
                              winds subsided to reduce fire risk, stranding millions without basic energy. While the
                              shutdown was the result of a multitude of factors, it is emblematic of just how poorly
                              designed and managed the infrastructure of the 20th century is for the climate of the

                              The estimates of future investment simultaneously demonstrate the enormous
         TRILLION             opportunity for change and the downside risk of failing to change: according to
       An estimated $95       one estimate, more than 75% of the infrastructure to be built by 2050 does not yet

            services.         “sustainable” investment. Driven in part to meet larger goals of the international
                              agreements and national commitments—the Paris Agreement Nationally Determined
                              Contributions (NDCs), Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) Post-2020 Framework,
                              the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the New York Declaration on
                              Forests (NYDF)—the paradigm shift has clear momentum. Influential institutions
                              across sectors—from multilateral development banks to private sector developers and
                              non-profits—have diagnosed the many challenges and necessary changes across the
                              infrastructure development cycle to reorient current and future investments toward
                              these goals. So far, however, this push toward sustainable infrastructure has largely
                              been driven by—and largely understood in terms of—low-carbon investments and
                              continuing reduction of social and environmental impacts.

                              While essential to avoid the long-term worst-case scenarios of climate change, this
                              focus on low-carbon options and social and environmental frameworks to reduce
                              negative impacts has left some critical gaps that risk compromising equally important
                              needs to maintain and build resilience to the impacts of an already warming planet.
                              This does not mean that positive progress is not underway: examples of efforts to
                              plan at the appropriate scale around nature and the benefits it provides for people

                            PART 1: DEFINING THE CHALLENGE
                            Seemingly every day, new climate extremes emerge that challenge the fundamental
                            ability of our existing infrastructure to meet the basic food, water, and energy needs of
                            millions around the world. There is perhaps no better recent example than yet another
                            destructive fire season in California, where a stalled high-pressure system from a
                            lethargic jet stream slowed by warming sent 70-80 mph (112-130 kph) winds for days
                            across a tinderbox of vegetation and soil similarly dried out by new heat extremes.
                            For the first time ever, the state’s largest utility shut down its power grid for hundreds
                            of thousands of customers for days at a time until the winds subsided to reduce fire

                            innovation. While the result of multiple factors, including decades of deferred
                            maintenance, mismanagement, and incentives for people to live in fire prone areas,
                            this shutdown is emblematic of just how poorly the infrastructure of the 20th century is
                            adapted to the climate of the 21st.


    First                   Faced with these now regularly recurring extremes, ambition and global agreement to
                            tackle the dual challenges of climate change—reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
           EVER             building resilience to the increasingly damaging impacts and future risks of a changing

                            for decades, the similar crisis of decreasing biodiversity in nearly every habitat on
                            the planet has not yet motivated global efforts to stem biodiversity declines on a
                            comparable global scale. There are signs momentum is shifting toward progress, with a
                            global push by many governments and NGOS for a “global deal on nature.”3 The SDGs
                            attempt to address both trends while simultaneously bringing hundreds of millions out
                            of poverty, but pose enormous challenges to governments that have historically failed to
                            balance environmental and economic development trade-offs.

                            Perhaps no single issue better demonstrates the challenge of effectively managing these
                            various trade-offs toward more sustainable and climate resilient development than
                            infrastructure. Planning for the infrastructure of the 21st century creates perhaps the
                            single most important opportunity to integrate these various global agreements, country
                            commitments, and fundamental science-based needs to maintain biodiversity, reduce
                            emissions, build resilience, and bring millions around the world out of poverty. As yet
                            more calamities driven by a warming planet demonstrate—from the California and
                            Amazon fires to more cyclones and hurricanes that are the most damaging in a given
                            nation’s history—the need to balance these trade-offs is becoming pressingly urgent.

                                    climate, WWF partnered with Arup to review more than 90 cases of regional planning
                                    for infrastructure around the world.39 To test the hypothesis that examples of such

                                    given that the importance of climate risks and ecosystem services benefits have been

PART 2: LEARNING FROM RELEVANT CASE STUDIES


                                 5)	 The technical challenge of integrating climate and ecosystem services.
                                     From a purely technical ecosystem services and climate science modeling
                                     perspective, this case demonstrates fundamental limitations in assessing the
                                     dynamics of natural capital and ecosystem services in a changing climate. This
                                     is partly due to data limitations, but more fundamentally due to the lack of a
                                     demonstrable, replicable modeling approach—and the relevant expertise—in
                                     the scientific community to properly assess how ecosystem services like water
                                     provision, fisheries, or coastal protection will change as the shocks and stressors
                                     and longer-term shifts worsen as the planet warms. While identification of
                                     important ecosystem service-sheds certainly helps prioritize some areas essential
                                     to reducing risks and exposure to climate change impacts—for example, coastal
                                     mangroves and coral reefs—key questions remain around how climate will reduce
                                     nature’s ability to continue to provide such benefits and the resulting stress on
                                     surrounding communities and infrastructure, including how to most effectively
                                     manage both social and ecological systems to ensure continued services provision
                                     into the future.
                                 	    In general, progress is being made to better integrate the climate and ecosystem
                                      services modeling fields (outlined in more detail in the next section), but data-
                                      limited contexts like northern Mozambique, alongside more fundamental climate
                                      model resolution limits, will always limit the utility of such modeling, requiring
                                      additionally rigorous ground-truthing. Nonetheless, these first maps of ecosystem
                                      services provide an essential baseline both to guide planning and to use for
                                      continuous improvement as more data analyses are performed in the coming
                                      decades.

                               These challenges are in many ways unique to Mozambique but are also clearly universal
                               to development contexts in developing and developed economies alike. Interministerial
                               endorsement of a natural capital-based, green economy framework is a rare, laudable
                               achievement; these challenges, however, demonstrate just how difficult implementation
                               of such an approach can be. This said, the challenges are not insurmountable: there is a
                               real chance for a different trajectory, one defined by a regional economy and livelihoods
                               built around natural capital, ecosystem services, and climate resilience, especially if key
                               government and non-government stakeholders are all pushing for a similar result. The
                               country’s two recent cyclones give a powerful rationale for embracing a more integrated
                               approach: as the Palma administrator stated at the close of an already planned but
                               newly important workshop on planning for resilience and natural capital, they didn’t
                               fully appreciate what resilience was or how to go about it, but now realize just how
                               critical it is to embrace moving forward.

                               Taking the lessons from this Mozambique case and others, the next section outlines
                               an approach for solving some of these challenges through a revised planning
                               framework that explicitly accounts for climate risks and ecosystem services through
                               existing tools and stakeholder engagement best practice, built around future scenario
                               planning.

                                approach to infrastructure planning focused on improved spatial land-use planning
                                with natural capital, ecosystem services, and resilience at its core is needed. It should
                                aim to fill the three previously identified information gaps at the earliest possible
                                strategic planning stages of development:

                                   1)	 The totality of services provided by ecosystems and the reliance upon
                                       them by surrounding or downstream populations and economies.
                                   2)	 The cumulative, ecosystem-scale impacts potentially posed by
                                       planned infrastructure.
                                   3)	 Current and future infrastructure needs based on these dependencies
                                       and other critical trends like population growth, migration, and projected
                                       economic development.
                                   4)	 Current impacts and likely future risks to 1, 2, and 3 from continued
                                       warming and the necessary pathways and planning steps to facilitate adaptation
