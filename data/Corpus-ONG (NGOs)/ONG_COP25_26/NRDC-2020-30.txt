INTRODUCTION




I
        n 2015 at COP21, nearly 200 countries adopted the Paris Agreement. Parties to
        this historic accord committed to take steps both to limit warming to well under
        2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and to increase resilience to the
        impacts of climate change. Healthy oceans are a crucial component in the global
        fight against climate change, but only a handful of countries currently include
meaningful ocean-based mitigation and adaptation actions in their plans to meet their
Paris goals.

This Ocean-Climate Guide to Action provides options
for addressing this omission, which carries a heavy cost.
Globally, ocean-based economic activities are estimated to
be worth over a trillion dollars annually (USD), supporting
hundreds of millions of jobs and providing protein to
billions of people.1 More fundamentally, our oceans
provide services that make life on earth possible, such
as producing oxygen and storing excess heat and carbon
dioxide, thereby slowing the rate of catastrophic warming.
The oceans are critical to the global fight against climate
change.
One example of their importance in that fight is through
the conservation and restoration of coastal “blue carbon”
ecosystems, which is an essential pillar of a strong climate
mitigation strategy. Seagrasses, mangrove forests, and
salt marshes are particularly effective at capturing and
sequestering carbon dioxide. When they are degraded,
they not only fail to act as carbon sinks but also become
sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition, countries must also act to adapt to the
impacts of climate change that we are observing in the
oceans and along our coasts. Greenhouse gas emissions
are causing an increasingly warm, deoxygenated, and
acidic marine environment. Consequently, coral reefs are
bleaching, marine ecosystems are degrading, and fisheries      This Ocean-Climate Guide to Action is a partial snapshot

FOUNDING INNOVATIVE INSTITUTIONS FOR OCEAN SCIENCE
AND PROTECTION



I
          n 2004 the California Legislature adopted the California Ocean Protection Act (COPA), creating
          the Ocean Protection Council (OPC).2 This first-of-its-kind governmental institution was
          intended to promote comprehensive and coordinated ocean and coastal management as the
          ocean program of the California Natural Resources Agency. Chaired by the secretary for Natural
          Resources, the seven-member council includes the secretary for Environmental Protection
as well as representatives from the state legislature and the public. OPC is charged with coordinating
state policy and scientific data collection related to coast and ocean resources among agencies as well as
identifying and recommending changes in law to the legislature to improve coastal and ocean management.
OPC helps coordinate activities of state agencies that work on ocean and coastal issues, including the
California Coastal Conservancy, California Coastal Commission, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and
Development Commission, State Water Board, Department of Fish and Wildlife, and others.


COPA also required OPC to establish a multidisciplinary     Key Elements of Success

CALIFORNIA’S CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM AND CALIFORNIA
CLIMATE INVESTMENTS



C
                    alifornia’s path to a cap-and-trade program formally began in 2006 with the passage of AB
                    32, the nation’s first comprehensive climate change policy. AB 32, and subsequent climate
                    legislation, set state greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets and charged the
                    California Air Resources Board (CARB) with identifying strategies to meet those targets.5


The cap-and-trade program is a key element of California’s
climate plan. It sets a statewide limit on the GHG sources
responsible for 85 percent of California’s emissions, with
the limit declining over time. The program also establishes
the carbon price signal needed to drive long-term
investment in cleaner fuels and energy efficiency. CARB
spent more than two years in a public process designing

FINANCING NATURAL RESOURCE INVESTMENTS WITH BONDS




C
                alifornia’s push to use bonds to finance investments in the state’s natural resources began
                in the late 1920s but accelerated in the late 1980s when the state struggled through two
                economic recessions. During those recessions it became clear that natural resource
                investments would fall far down the list of budget priorities when state funds were
                limited.10 In response to the need for dedicated funding, California state legislators and
environmental advocates began working outside the state budget process to craft language for, campaign
for, and work to implement natural resource bond measures.

MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY: FOSTERING OFFSHORE WIND
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH MULTIAGENCY INITIATIVES



C
                alifornia’s renewable energy legislation—the California Global Warming Solutions Act—
                became law in 2006. Spurred by California’s ambitious renewable energy targets, state
                agencies began to evaluate how they could harness offshore winds and waves to produce
                marine renewable energy alongside land-based renewables.21 By 2018, with legislation
                requiring California to transition to 100 percent renewable energy by December 31, 2045,
commercial and state interest in offshore wind development in California has increased greatly.22 Today
the California Energy Commission (CEC) leads the state’s offshore wind efforts, and the Ocean Protection
Council (OPC) works to ensure that any offshore wind development minimizes impacts to marine life,
fisheries, and cultural resources.

In 2010, OPC established the California Marine Renewable
Energy Working Group (CMREWG). The CMREWG is
comprised of state agencies working to improve regulatory
coordination among state and federal agencies with
jurisdiction relevant to marine renewable energy.23 In
addition to addressing regulatory issues around offshore
wind development, the working group is currently
identifying and prioritizing information, research, and
planning needs for permitting offshore wind energy
projects.24

REQUIRING CARGO SHIPS TO USE SHORESIDE POWER

                concern for communities because of the host of health problems to which these emissions

(CARB) evaluated cold ironing—that is, having ships plug into shore power—at various ports in 2006. In
its analysis, CARB estimated that ship emissions would triple by 2020 under business as usual.30 But if
modified dockside facilities could allow vessels to use shoreside power, diesel particulate matter (PM) and

percent emissions reduction by 2020. To encourage early
compliance, CARB created financial incentives through
state grant funding. These changes have reduced the
public health risk to neighboring communities and reduced
regional emissions.35
To enforce the At-Berth Regulation, enforcement staff
conducts audits of vessel fleets. For example, CARB
conducted 128 fleet audits from 2014 to 2016, reviewing
more than 12,000 vessel port visits. 36 CARB has reported
that, on average, ports in California have achieved their
targets, with a 51 percent reduction of onboard auxiliary
engine power use while at berth in 2015 and a 63 percent
reduction in 2016.37 In 2016, simply by using electricity
instead of diesel while at berth, fleets reduced NOx
emissions by 4.3 tons per day and PM emissions by 0.066
tons per day.38 CARB also estimates this policy reduces
CO2 emissions in California by 0.5 million metric tons
annually.39

                  40 nautical miles (nm) or 20 nm from shore.49 The first program of this kind in California
                  stemmed from growing concerns about air pollution in areas surrounding California’s
ports, particularly in the South Coast Air Basin.


A broader action plan to bring the air basin into
compliance with California’s quality air standards first
focused on reducing nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions from
ocean-going vessels entering and leaving California’s
ports.50 It was then that the California Air Resources
Board (CARB) and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) noticed reductions in NOx emissions when
ocean-going vessels slowed for safety purposes when
entering ports. When vessel speed was reduced from 24
knots to 12 knots, NOx emissions dropped by as much as
56 percent.51
In 2001 the EPA, CARB, the Port of Los Angeles (POLA),
the Port of Long Beach (POLB), shipping industry
representatives, and the U.S. Navy entered into a
memorandum of understanding outlining the first VSRP
in California. The initial memorandum expired in 2004,
but the POLA and the POLB have modified the VSRP
to further reduce emissions and encourage voluntary
participation with financial incentives.52 The POLA
attributes much of its success in reducing vessel pollution
to the VSRP strategy.

CREATING MARINE PROTECTED AREAS




C
               alifornia’s marine ecosystems are facing multiple, simultaneous climate change impacts,
               including ocean acidification, hypoxia, marine heat waves, and disrupted patterns of
               seasonal upwelling.62 These large-scale effects, combined with the more immediate
               and local stresses of overfishing and land-based pollution, are putting the resilience of
               California’s marine ecosystems at risk. Effectively managed Marine Protected Areas
(MPAs) can help restore ecosystems and increase their ability to withstand the stresses of climate change
and ocean acidification.63

Since the early 1900s, California has used MPAs as a
tool to preserve especially beautiful and biologically
diverse locations along its coast. However, in 1999 the
California Legislature identified the need to increase the
state’s effectiveness in protecting marine life, habitats,
and ecosystems and passed the Marine Life Protection
Act.64 This legislation mandated that the state Fish

and Game Commission and the California Department
of Fish and Wildlife use the latest science to redesign
and expand the state’s existing system of MPAs into a
network that protects marine ecosystems and California’s
natural heritage and provides improved recreational and
educational opportunities. The law also required the
state agencies to ensure effective MPA management and
enforcement.                                                   work together to implement the state’s collaboratively

PREPARING FOR SEA LEVEL RISE




S
                   e a level rise (SLR) poses a large threat to California’s economy, infrastructure, and natural
                    resources. Recognizing this, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2008 required state
                    agencies to coordinate a plan to adapt to SLR.69 In response, state agencies produced the
                    first California SLR guidance in 2010, requiring state agencies to support the development
                    of best-available SLR projections, and rely on these projections in their decision-making
                    processes.70

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change report issued in 2014 warned that at least
some amount of sea level rise would be unavoidable.71

Drawing from the call to action in that report, in 2015
then governor Jerry Brown established new interim
statewide greenhouse gas reduction goals and ordered
state agencies to factor climate change into their planning
and investment decisions.72 That same year the legislature
passed SB 379, a bill that required local governments to
incorporate climate adaptation and resiliency strategies
into the safety element of their general plans, as well as
SB 246, which created the Integrated Climate Adaptation
and Resiliency Program to coordinate local and state
adaptation strategies.73

           n 2007 the U.S. West Coast shellfish industry noticed a dramatic increase in oyster larva mortality
           in commercial hatcheries. The shellfish growers joined forces with government and academic
           scientists and determined that the larval die-offs occurred when the seawater flowing into
           aquaculture facilities had low pH and carbonate availability, indicating that ocean acidification was
           the culprit.77 This was later verified with meticulous collaborative research.

ADAPTING FISHERIES MANAGEMENT TO THE EFFECTS OF
CLIMATE CHANGE



C
                alifornia’s fishery resources are heavily influenced by the dynamics of the California
                Current, which is believed to be changing as the result of climate change and ocean
                acidification. Scientists have observed and predict a continuation of warmer summer
                temperatures, altered patterns of upwelling, more frequent heat waves, more frequent
                episodes of low-oxygen and lower-pH waters, and an increase in harmful algal blooms
in the California Current and other eastern boundary upwelling systems.84 California fishermen are
increasingly affected by these changes, as illustrated by recent closures in the Dungeness crab fishery
due to harmful algal blooms.

regimes, protections for stressed species, or changes to

In 2017, in response to growing concerns about the
increasingly dramatic effects of climate change on marine
ecosystems, the state assembled an expert scientific
panel, a working group of the Ocean Protection Council
Scientific Advisory Team (OPC-SAT), to examine what
steps were needed to ready California’s fisheries for

climate change.86 The panel’s findings were used by the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife to inform
the Marine Life Management Act Master Plan revision.
Several report recommendations were adopted in the
amended Master Plan, including routinely addressing
potential climate impacts in fishery management plans,
conducting vulnerability assessments for affected fisheries
and coastal communities, and increasing the use of
management strategy evaluation in fisheries management
to explicitly account for growing uncertainties.
Although the plan adopted recommendations from OPC’s
report, the state still needs to develop strategies and
actions to implement them. This means California will
need the best available scientific information and tools to
create, improve, and enforce fishery management across
the state.

72	California Executive Order B-30-15 established “a new interim statewide greenhouse gas emission reduction target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by
      2030 . . . in order to ensure California meets its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.” California Executive Order B-30-15, April 2015, https://

74	The policy aligns the deadline for adoption with the revision timeline of the local general plans. Local governments with existing climate adaptation goals are able to summarize and reference
      these in the safety element of the general plan instead of designing a new plan.
75	There are two types of approaches to SLR projection research: scenario-based projections and probabilistic projections. Scenario-based SLR projections create a range of possible outcomes
      estimated using different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios but do not analyze the likelihood of the various outcomes. The IPCC AR5 report (2015) created probabilistic SLR projections,
      which estimate the likelihood of several SLR futures; the report also introduced new ice melt simulations. Although California updated its statewide SLR guidance document in 2013, the
      2013 plan relied on scenario-based SLR projections. Many scientists favored the probabilistic SLR projections in IPCC AR5, and OPC has now established this as the norm. The updated SLR
      guidance document was created in collaboration by the Ocean Protection Council, California Natural Resources Agency, Governor’s Office of Planning and Research, and California Ocean
      Science Trust. See Gary Griggs et al. (California Ocean Protection Council Science Advisory Team Working Group), Rising Seas in California: An Update on Sea-Level Rise Science, California
