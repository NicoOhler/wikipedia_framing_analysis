       carbon emissions and also safeguarding rivers and the abundant and
       diverse resources and services they provide to society?

       carbon, reliable, accessible, affordable, and low impact. Here we review the different
       technologies that will make up these sustainable power systems and current
       trends in their costs, deployment, risks, and opportunities.

Chapter 4




       In this chapter, we explore the technical feasibility of low-carbon, low-cost
       and low-impact power systems through descriptions of the modeling and planning
       methods that can be used to design grids. We then summarize modeling studies
       that illustrate power systems that achieve these three objectives.

       The challenge of shifting power
       generation across the globe to
       renewable energy sources while
       meeting growing demand for power
       and addressing environmental
       needs is unprecedented.


       This transformation will be driven by technological
       advances and economies of scale that have driven
       down costs to competitive levels, combined with
       policies that removed barriers and opened markets to
       new renewables. However, ensuring this occurs rapidly
       enough to secure the climate depends on key policy,
       institutional, technical, and financial reforms. These
       reforms will be the shared responsibility of many

       7.1 INTRODUCTION

       This report has offered a vision of how
       the world could meet its electricity
       needs through power systems that are
       low carbon, low cost and low impact on
       environmental and social resources.


       To ground this vision in reality, this chapter explores
       how this vision could be implemented in the Mekong
       River basin in Southeast Asia. Here we integrate all
       the various components of the report — modeling of
       grids and river basin processes, trends in investment                                                                                                                                                        KEY POINTS

     DRIVER OF THE RENEWABLE REVOLUTION
     In 2013, China launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an outbound investment strategy
     expected to exceed US$1 trillion in total investment volume over the next decade21. China’s stated
     goals of the BRI are to promote development and cooperation through infrastructure investments
     in countries along the route of the historic Silk Road, which connected East Asia and Southeast
     Asia with East Africa, West Asia and Southern Europe.
