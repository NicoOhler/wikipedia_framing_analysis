Facebook ramps up efforts to counter climate change misinformation

Brett Molina | USA TODAY Facebook says it is stepping up efforts to dispute myths and misinformation about climate change, including adding labels to some posts. The social network hosts a Climate Science Information Center, which will now feature a section debunking common myths about climate change, such as the impact of carbon dioxide in the air, the company said Thursday. Facebook will also add "informational labels" to some climate-related posts in the United Kingdom linking back to the center. That feature will become available in more countries soon. Facebook is also expanding access to the center to more countries, including Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. It's already available in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the U.S. First look: 'Splatoon 3' and 'Star Wars: Hunters' among new video games headed to Nintendo Switch Google Doodle: Poet, civil rights activist Audre Lorde celebrated on her 87th birthday Climate change is among several topics where Facebook has moved to curb the spread of false information on its platform. The company started taking down misinformation on Facebook and Instagram related to COVID-19 vaccines earlier this month. The social network also cracked down on misinformation following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, ultimately banning former President Donald Trump from the platform. The Facebook Oversight Board is nearing a decision on whether to maintain the ban or allow Trump back on Facebook.
