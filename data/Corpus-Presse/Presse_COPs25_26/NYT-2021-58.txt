As FEMA sends aid, the White House warns that America is
not ready for climate change.

By Thomas Kaplan

As   Texas   continues   to   struggle   with   cold   weather,   power   outages   and   water   shortages,   the   Federal
Emergency   Management   Agency   has   made   available   60   generators   and   fuel   for   critical   locations   like
hospitals and water facilities, a White House ofﬁcial said on Thursday.

The agency has also provided 729,000 liters of water, 225,000 meals and tens of thousands of blankets,
according to the ofﬁcial, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, the White House homeland security adviser.

Later Thursday, the White House announced that President Biden had declared an emergency in Louisiana,
following emergency declarations for Texas and Oklahoma.

Speaking   to   reporters   earlier   in   the   day,   Ms.   Sherwood-Randall   said   this   week’s   extreme   weather
demonstrated again that “climate change is real and it’s happening now, and we’re not adequately prepared
for it.”

“In particular, power grids across our country, particularly in Texas, are overloaded by the demands that are
placed on them under these circumstances, and the infrastructure is not built to withstand these extreme
conditions,” she said. “Going forward, we will be leading an effort to strengthen and harden our critical
infrastructure so that it can be prepared to meet the full spectrum of challenges that we’re likely to face in
the future.”
