Climate change may cause dairy and potato shortages

By Emma Gatten

A SHORTFALL in milk and potatoes could occur within the next 30 years under worst-case climate change
scenarios, the Met Ofﬁce has said.

Research published in the journal Climate Risk Management found that heat stress in dairy cattle, which can
lead to lower milk production, is projected to increase signiﬁcantly in key dairy regions of the UK, particularly
south western England.

While temperatures that cause heat stress currently occur around two to three days a year in the South
West, this could increase to more than 30 days between 2051 and 2070.

The study also covered the  climate change   impacts   on   the   potato   sector   due   to   late   blight,   a   disease
affecting potato crops, which occurs in warm, humid weather. It found that late blight was likely to occur
more often across the UK within 30 to 50 years, with the greatest increases in western and northern regions.
In east Scotland, which has a lot of potato farming, blight may occur around 70 per cent more often than it
does now.

The study was based on worst-case climate change scenarios, which the Met Ofﬁce said were "credible"
because current mitigation efforts, such as the net-zero pledge, were not guaranteed.

Dr Freya Garry, the study author, said there could be even greater impacts on dairy farms in other areas of
the country: "Our study found that future dairy cattle in parts of the South East may be exposed to heat
stress for an extra two months per year. At the moment, cattle in the South East experience around a week
per year of these conditions."
