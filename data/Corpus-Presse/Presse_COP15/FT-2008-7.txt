Observer: Defeating climate change by air

Wanted: one Churchill. Job description: to vanquish climate change. Apply to: Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Group.

The Virgin Atlantic chief told the United Nations this week that he was planning to set up a "war room" on climate change.

Funded with a few million dollars of his own money, the organisation will consider "new and radical" ideas on climate change. He warned global warming would only be tackled if people took it as seriously as they did the British effort to win the second world war.

Sir Richard is tight-lipped on his favourites for the post of "the new Churchill" needed to head the war room, but Al Gore might have some free time while, if former British prime minister Tony Blair doesn't get to be president of Europe, he too will be looking for a new challenge.

What will be the first task of the new Churchill? Climate experts tell us our runaway consumption of fossil fuels and the goods we make with them are causing the problem. That would have been familiar to the original Churchill, one of whose first actions in fighting Hitler was to ration essentials such as food, clothing and petrol.

During the war, British train stations and roadsides were plastered with posters asking: "Is your journey really necessary?"

So surely the new climate Churchill will put up the same posters at Virgin check-in desks.
