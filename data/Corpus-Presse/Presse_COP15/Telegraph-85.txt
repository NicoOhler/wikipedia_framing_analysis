Telegraph (London, UK) Saturday, July 10, 2010'CLIMATEGATE' FAILS TO WHIP UP A STORMGeoffrey LeanNow that the third inquiry into the so-called "Climategate" emails has failed to substantiate the allegations that this was the "scientific scandal of the century", let's look at a much more unexpected verdict.The result of Sir Muir Russell's inquiry had been widely predicted - both by those who have long known that there was no evidence of scientific malpractice (but plenty of excessive secrecy and flouting of Freedom of Information laws), and by sceptics forecasting a whitewash.The public's reaction, however, has been much more surprising. Thanks to the free run enjoyed by the sceptics - through cowardice among scientists and green groups - it should have had a big impact. But new polls on both sides of the Atlantic suggest that, while acceptance of global warming has been falling, the much-hyped furore is not responsible.An American poll found that only 9 per cent of the respondents thought that "Climategate" indicated that climate scientists are untrustworthy, about the same proportion as told a Scottish one that they had altered their opinions as a result of it. A survey for the BBC indicated that just a quarter of those who had heard of it had changed their views - and that most of these had become more convinced of global warming, not less. Polls in both Britain and America show that the cold winter was much more influential in changing minds, something the present heatwaves may mitigate. And indeed, the latest signs are of increases in the already large majority who are sure that humanity is warming the climate. Given that this seems to have been a storm in a piece of crockery, should we rename it "Climatecup"?
