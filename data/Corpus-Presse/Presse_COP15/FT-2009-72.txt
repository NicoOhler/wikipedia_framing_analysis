Brown to warn on global warming
By James Boxell

Gordon Brown will today issue his most dire warning yet on the threat of global warming, arguing that it will be "irretrievably too late" to halt environmental catastrophe if agreement is not reached at December's climate change summit in Copenhagen, writes James Boxell.

The comments will be made in a speech to the Major Economies Forum in London, bringing together 17 of the world's biggest greenhouse gas-emitting countries.

Ministers hope the talks will improve the chances of a climate change treaty being agreed at the summit.

There has been some progress ahead of the summit on matters such as developing countries dropping demands for access to rich countries' technology. But there are still concerns that progress is stalled in other areas, notably on the issue of financial assistance to poor nations. Mr Brown will say: "I believe agreement at Copenhagen is possible. But we must frankly face the plain fact that our negotiators are not getting to agreement quickly enough. So I believe that leaders must engage directly to break the impasse."
