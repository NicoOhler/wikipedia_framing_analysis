Greenpeace Parody of Newspaper Spotlights Climate
By THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE

PARIS -- The environmental group Greenpeace on Thursday distributed a spoof version of The International Herald Tribune, in an effort to draw attention to climate change as European Union leaders gathered to discuss the issue in Brussels.

"Heads of state agree historic climate-saving deal,"" the parody proclaimed on Page 1, along with a picture of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission. It was dated Dec. 19, 2009, the day after the end of the planned United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.

The newspaper said in a statement that it had contacted Greenpeace and asked it to remove any fake Web pages from its site, and that it had received no advance notice of the project. The Herald Tribune is owned by The New York Times Company.

"The I.H.T. is a trusted resource for world opinion leaders and to have our name and image paraded among this community as a politically motivated publicity stunt is wholly contrary to our values of independence and accuracy," the paper said in a statement.

Gerd Leipold, executive director of Greenpeace International, urged the newspaper to consider the spoof a "compliment" to the paper's "history of excellent coverage on a variety of issues, including climate change."

Greenpeace said 50,000 copies of the spoof I.H.T. were distributed, mostly in Brussels. In a letter to the newspaper, Mr. Leipold said the goal was to show "world leaders, and all of us, the future we might have if they do right by the planet."
