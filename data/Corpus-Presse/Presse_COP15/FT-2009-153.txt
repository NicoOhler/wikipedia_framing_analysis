Obama warns 'climate deal in the balance'
By Ed Crooks and Fiona Harvey in Copenhagen

US president Barack Obama warned on Friday that a global agreement to fight the threat of climate change was "in the balance" at the United Nations talks in Copenhagen.

Speaking to about 120 world leaders gathered to agree a deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, he warned that the negotiations were running out of time, and urged them to be part of a "historic decision" to agree a deal, even if they were not happy with every aspect.

"As the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt. It hangs in the balance," he said.

"We are running short of time, and at this point the question is whether we will move forward or split apart; whether we prefer posturing to action"

Mr Obama's speech was made in a plenary meetingUnited Nations climate talks of about 120 heads of state and government. The meeting was delayed by almost two hours, as a group of about 20 leaders and their representatives, including Mr Obama but not Wen Jiabao, China's premier, met to try to thrash out a deal.

Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said the world was closer than ever to a first global deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but "only hours remain to close these final gaps".

The turbulent negotiations on Friday morning delayed what could be a decisive meeting between Mr Obama and Mr Wen.

Addressing the gathering of leaders, Mr Wen said he was "deeply aware of the heavy responsibility" he faced, and promised that China would "continue to make unremitting efforts" to fight climate change.

However, developed and developing countries still seemed some way from a deal on Friday, with bargaining continuing over both a political agreement that could be issued from the meeting and the details of any formal decisions from the UN process.

Achim Steiner, the executive secretary at the UN Environment Programme, said: "The talks are in crisis."

Mr Wen took a tough line in his speech, insisting that any agreement should be based on established UN processes, not new streamlined proposals put forward by developed countries.

Leaders and ministers from many of the largest countries met until 1am on Friday and then reconvened later in the morning to discuss the outlines of the possible political agreement.

Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the prime minister of Denmark who is the president of the talks, said the discussions had been "very fruitful".

However, Jairam Ramesh, India's finance minister, said no agreement had been reached.

Officials from leading developed countries said all the elements of a deal were on the table but countries were still wasting time discussing technical details rather than the substantive issues.

There is a consensus on setting a goal that the global temperature should rise by no more than 2ÂºC, a decision already adopted by big economies, including China and India,in the summer.

Developed countries are also close to agreeing an offer of funding for poor countries worth $100bn a year by 2020, from both government and private sector finance, after Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, backed the plan on Thursday morning.

However, there is still haggling over scale of the emissions curbs that leading economies should make, with some countries pressing for deeper reductions and others resisting.

The bilateral meeting between Mr Obama and Mr Wen will bring together the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide, between them responsible for about 40 per cent of global emissions.

The positions of the two countries have become closer in recent days, thanks to the US backing for the funding plan, and a Chinese offer to be "transparent" about the actions it is taking to curb its emissions, even though it has not given full details of the form that transparency would take. China continues to insist it will not accept any international scrutiny that violates its national sovereignty.

If Mr Obama and Mr Wen can reach agreement, China should be able to swing many of its allies in the developing world behind a deal.

Such a deal, if converted into a treaty next year, would be the first to bind all countries to take action on climate change.

The 1997 Kyoto protocol was never ratified by the US, and made no demands on developing countries, notably China.
