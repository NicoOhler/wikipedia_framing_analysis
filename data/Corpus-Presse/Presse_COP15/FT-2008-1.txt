PV Crystalox Solar to capitalise on climate change fear
By PAN KWAN YUK

Strong demand for solar energy, triggered by concerns about global warming and oil prices, lifted profits at PV Crystalox Solar.

The company, one of the biggest manufacturers of silicon components for the solar electricity generation industry, said it expected 2007 profit to be ahead of analysts' estimates after "a strong financial performance" at the end of the year.

Earnings before interest and tax, excluding one-time costs, would not be less than Euros 70m (Pounds 52.2m) for the year to December 31, it said. Analysts had expected the company to report Ebit of about Pounds 46m for 2007.

Iain Dorrity, chief executive, said interest in renewable energy had grown rapidly as governments pushed companies to reduce carbon emissions and oil prices had climbed. "The outlook for the industry is very good," he said. "Demand shows no sign of abating."

The European Photovoltaic Industry Association estimates the global market for solar power, measured by sales, will grow by an average of 37 per cent a year through to 2010.

Established in 1982, when the solar market was very small, PV Crystalox became the UK's largest solar energy float when its shares joined the main market last June.

The company exports 75 per cent of its products to Japan, where its biggest customer is Sharp. The rest is sold in Europe.

The company said the limited availability of feedstock was the only limitation in meeting demand for the multicrystalline silicone wafers used in solar electricity generation.

A new factory in Germany is expected to give the company its own source of silicon from 2009.

Shares in PV Crystalox Solar fell 2p to 153 1/2p. They are still trading 18 per cent above the 130p float price.
