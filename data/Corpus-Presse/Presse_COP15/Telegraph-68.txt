Telegraph (London, UK) Thursday, March 18, 2010HOW BRITAIN MUST LIVE TO HIT CLIMATE TARGETSLouise Gray Environment CorrespondentALL cars will need to be electric and most homes will need solar panels, while 10,000 onshore wind turbines and 40 new low-carbon power stations will also be required for the Government to stand a chance of meeting climate change targets, it has been claimed.The Royal Academy of Engineering, which set out how Britain could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, said that even if electricity needs fell, the Government would still have to engage in "the biggest programme of investment and social change the UK has ever seen" over the next four decades.The report assumed that the maximum level of renewable electricity would be installed, including 9,600 wind turbines on land and 10,000 at sea.The Severn Barrage would have to go ahead as well as 1,000 miles of wave machines and further installations for tidal power. Most of the country's 25million households would need solar panels and to replace boilers with pumps taking heat from the air or ground.The country would need to build 40 low-carbon power stations such as nuclear, or coal with carbon capture and storage that kept carbon dioxide underground. The transport sector would have to run on electricity from renewables or low-carbon energy such as nuclear, meaning a national network of charging points.The authors compared the scale of the challenge with the Victorians building the sewerage system or the manufacture of Spitfires in the Second World War, and warned of blackouts without a large infrastructure programme. The Royal Society, the national academy of science, has begun a study into "geoengineering".It fears measures to stop climate change, such as launching mirrors into space to reflect the sun's heat, or fertilising the oceans to grow algae to absorb more CO2, could harm the wider environment.
