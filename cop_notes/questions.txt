is the data already normalized?
is change linear?
    is a 0.1 diff near the middle equivalent to a 0.1 diff at one end of the scale?

aggregate all COPs into one
    e.g. compare how NYT reported about COPs differently from FT
    takes into consideration that we dont have an equal amount of articles for all COPs
        e.g. very few FT articles for COP15, but many for COP21

write function which takes two dumps/plots and returns the difference 
    e.g. compare FT with average press,
         compare avg IGO, NGO, press

average problem
    maybe there are way more articles of one source which skews everything
comparison of one source vs average of all other sources excluding itself would be interesting
