Methodology:
    look for "significant" deviations from average
    problem: average skewed if source contributes more to avg,
                which is definitely the case for our data
    maybe compare each source with average of other sources?
        need to merge csvs for this - not too bad

press vs NGO vs IGO
    are reports and press articles even comparable?
        very distintive writing style
        probably about different topics?
            reports give an overview/a summary
            press articles report often report about specific/concrete issues/incidents
    clear differences
    IGO vs press
        fairness, loyalty, authority
        slightly more care
        sanctity/degradation varies, avg constant
    NGO vs press

        slighty more care
    NGO vs IGO
        harm, cheating, betrayal, subversion varies slightly, avg constant
        slightly more sanctity
